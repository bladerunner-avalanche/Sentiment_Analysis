            "Rating: 10, Review: There's nothing like the first in a series, is there? The introduction to the characters, the immersion into the fictional world, the first time you laugh, cry, care, and fear for someone's safety can never be repeated. No matter how many Harry Potter movies they crank out, or if they ever remake them in the future, none will come close to the wonderful first film, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone.\n",
            "Rating: 8, Review: Having read the first few Harry Potter books before 2001 and hearing about the hype for the first movie, I was excited. I heard there was going to be an all-British cast (which makes sense, right?) and we'd get to see a live version of one of the defining novels of our generation. From what I remember I went with my family and a family friend to see the movie the day after Christmas and was pleasantly amazed. After the movie was over, I watched the credits and discovered some familiar names (the late Alan Rickman, Sister Act's Maggie Smith, James Bond 007's Robbie Coltrane, and Star Wars' Warwick Davis); others not so familiar (the kids, some of whom had their debut). But it was a good movie and was a party of colors and sights for all to see. This is easily my favorite of all the Harry Potter films. The catalyst of the movie series!\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: Once upon a time (and not that long ago), in the vivid, fertile imagination of author J.K. Rowling, a character was born:  A boy.  A young boy named Harry, who was destined to become one of the most beloved characters to emerge from a work of fiction in a long, long time, and was quickly embraced by young and old alike in all corners of the world.  And now, thanks to the magic of the cinema, Harry and his companions fairly leap from the pages of the novel to the silver screen in the phenomenal motion picture, `Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,' directed by Chris Columbus and written for the screen by Steve Kloves.  Indeed, Harry Potter is a boy, but not just any boy; because Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) just happens to be a wizard.  But, orphaned as a baby, Harry has been raised by his Aunt Petunia (Fiona Shaw) and Uncle Vernon Dursley (Richard Griffiths), who never let him in on the fact that he was, well-- what he was.  It seems that Petunia didn't approve of her own sister-- Harry's mother-- because she was a witch; nor of Harry's father because he, too, was a wizard.  When Harry turns eleven, however, the secret is out of the bag when-- after some strange goings-on-- a giant of a man named Rubeus Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane) shows up at the Dursley's door to collect Harry and take him off to `Hogwarts,' a school for wizards and witches and all who would perfect the gift with which they were born:  The gift of magic!  And from the moment Harry boards the train (from station platform nine-and-three-quarters) that will take him to his destiny, the magic is alive-- for Harry, and for the audience, as well; and it's a journey you will never forget.\n",
            "Rating: 8, Review: Like a lot of others, I refused to watch this film when it was originally released, thinking it was going to be another movie for kids, loosely taken from the source. Was I ever wrong? \n",
            "Rating: , Review: I watched this movie first time when I was left with no choice. My expectations were extremely low as I always wondered if Harry Potter books were over-hyped. How-ever after watching the movie it did make me a Harry Potter movie fan. And needless to say - this continues to remain my favourite of HP series. That brings to a point here.... the effect of expectations over a movie. True, expectations reduce joy.\n",
            "Rating: 8, Review: Ah, the first film adaptation of the beloved Harry Potter series. Harry Potter is an 11-year-old boy who comes to find out that he is a wizard. He lives with his uncaring Muggle (non magic) aunt, uncle, and cousin since his parents died when he was a baby. They were murdered by a dark and powerful evil wizard named Lord Voldemort. Harry would be dead too, but was miraculously saved, making him something of a legend. Upon learning of his guarded magic roots, Harry gets enrolled in Hogwarts- a British school for witches and wizards. While there he learns to come into his own, meet people that are actually good to him, and learn more of his dark past. Looking back, I don't know if it was a good idea to have Chris Columbus direct this, as he does have a reputation for being something of a hack, albeit a decent one. I think his direction is okay here. Yeah, retrospectively it could have been better, but it could also have been much worse. At least with him at the helm we get a good amount of whimsy to go along with a bit of menace, and that's a good thing, as the book was likewise not too heavy on the darker stuff (though that sure changed as time went on). Many liberties are taken, which is weird since the book is quite short, and the film is two and a half hours. It does get the point across decently enough though, and also works as a piece for those unfamiliar with the source material. John Williams provides great music, there's wonderful art direction and set design, and there's some nifty set pieces too. Featuring an all-British cast, this film is impeccably cast, and the performances are good too. Finding decent child actors is hard, but they really scored here. My enjoyment of this movie has waned over time, but it's still not a terrible piece of work by any means, so check it out.\n",
            "Rating: 7, Review: I enjoyed this movie immensely. But, like \"The Phantom Menace,\" I've had a very hard time viewing it objectively. There was so much anticipation leading up to its release, I simply enjoyed the experience of being there. Having read all four books in the series a few times each, I am overly familiar with the events in the story. As I watched the movie, my continuing thought was \"How well will the next part of the story be translated to the screen?\" rather than \"How entertaining is this film overall?\" I have trouble answering the latter question because I was already entertained by watching a wonderful story dramatized, so I'll never know how I'd have reacted had I seen this movie without having read the books.\n",
            "Rating: 8, Review: I really liked this film, but I much prefer the book, which has a lot more magic and wonder. Daniel Radcliffe is very likable as Harry, and he is given solid support by a funny Rupert Grint and a good Emma Watson, though she was annoying at times. The scene stealer was definitely Robbie Coltrane; I actually can't imagine anyone else playing Hagrid, Coltrane was just hilarious. Alan Rickman and Maggie Smith were also great, but for me the standout was the late Richard Harris. Now I much prefer Harris's interpretation of Dumbledore. He was soft-spoken, and actually fitted the part better. Both of these qualities were lost in the interpretation that Michael Gambon gave. I am not saying that Michael Gambon was bad, he just wasn't my ideal choice for Harris's replacement. The film is fairly faithful to its source material, and looks very beautiful. However, it is a bit long, and very young children may find Voldemort too frightening. I know because I have triplet brother and sisters who saw it, and couldn't sleep for about a month after viewing. In conclusion, a very good film, well performed and quite dark. 8/10 Bethany Cox\n",

            "Rating: 10, Review: When I first saw this movie I was ten years old, the same age the characters where supposed to be. My older cousin and her boyfriend took me to the Mall to watch a movie. Back then I wasn't going very often to the cinema, due to the fact that my parents didn't have time and I wasn't old enough to go alone to any theater. The movie captivated my attention like nothing before and I became so interested in anything that had to do with this movie, and I heard that it was made after a book. I didn't had Internet back then, but I found the first book at a library and convinced my mother to buy it. That's how I became obsessed with reading and writing.\n",
            "Rating: 8, Review: During my childhood, the earlier Harry Potter books got me into the franchise and especially Fantasy Literature in general. They had thought provoking writing, likeable characters, and compelling world building.

            "Rating: 9, Review: This movie captures most aspects of the book perfectly. Being the first in the franchise, it has to do a lot of world building. But the writers and the director of this movie managed to keep things simple and to the point.\n",
            "Rating: 7, Review: Over-hyped but still enjoyable \"event\" movie, one of the biggest of 2001 until LORD OF THE RINGS comes out, and a film in which every million of the budget is put up on screen in the special effects. What I found most refreshing about this blockbuster is that the entire cast is made up of British actors and actresses! It makes a change for an expensive blockbuster movie to be thus but there you go, HARRY POTTER is indeed a unique movie. Now I'm not one of those people with lots of time on their hands to read the never-ending Harry Potter books (too busy watching cult movies I'm afraid), but the film has turned out pretty much as I would have expected from the adverts. Although it's overly sentimental (blame it on director Chris Columbus) and aimed at children, adults can still enjoy it for the excellent pacing (rarely does the two-and-a-half hour running time drag) and the plethora of special - and some not so special - effects on view throughout.\n",
            "Rating: 8, Review: Not a perfect story, but a lovely introduction into these characters and J. K. Rowling's magical world of wizards. Lots of great bits here, like the sorting hat, invisibility cloak, troll encounter, and quidditch match (even if the rules for this game are absurd). The casting is excellent, including the principal three (Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint) and the teachers at Hogwarts (Alan Rickman, Maggie Smith, and Richard Harris). The film was a little too long and had scenes that seemed a little disconnected, leading to a rather brief, anticlimactic ending, but overall there's a reason the franchise was so popular, and this got it off the ground in good form.\n",

            "Rating: 7, Review: It's seem like just yesterday, when the movie about the boy whom lived, was about to come out. People were wondering if the Harry Potter's books by J.K Rowling could easily be translated into the big screen. Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone AKA Sorcerer's Stone directed by Chris Columbus, indeed show that it was somewhat possible. The story follows Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe)'s first year at Hogwarts School of Wizardry as he discovers his gift and destiny against the dark forces of magic. The movie like the other films are cut into two plots directions. One is about student life at Hogwarts during the school-year, while the other half is about the mystery that Harry Potter must uncovered that year. It works well as a long read novel, but in movie form: its means a long sit through. The movie pacing is so long. It takes forever to get to the main plot of Harry Potter finding the Philosopher Stone. There are is a lot of filler scenes that could be cut away. I dislike how the Philosopher Stone is one-time movie McGuffin. For the best of my knowledge, the Philosopher stone plays no factor after this movie, and never mention again after this film. The third act, mostly comes out of nowhere. The twist toward the end, was pretty predictable, if you readt the books, but pretty interesting. Another thing about the movie is how non-logical the movie is. It really baffled me, how much exposition, it needed. Even an hour in the film, there were a lot of random odd things happening without much explaining. It gets more confusing as long bits of the book, like the Centaur showing in the woods, were shorten in the film. It gets worst for the centaur, as he wouldn't play a factor, in any of the later films, despite, saving Harry Potter from Voldermort. Hermione Granger (Emma Watson) was also cut short. Her riddle solving in the book was cut from the film. Several minor characters have been removed from the film version, as well. Despite those, the movie is really close to the novel. In my opinion, don't bother, trying to understand the logic of all the wizard terms, because it will take you out of the fantasy movie, and give you a headache. Still, there were some really dumb things to nitpick here like why would Professor Dumbledore (Richard Harris), even allow Harry Potter to stay with the Dursley's family when he knows that they're horrible people. Honestly, the Dursleys could had killed Harry Potter with the childhood neglect! What was he thinking? Harry Potter could had commit suicide, or gone crazy like Lord Voldermort! What an idiot! The whole movie is about children being danger all the time. I don't care if they're wizards in training, I'm surprise that the death tolls of students dying isn't as high as it should be. The school staff is questionable at times. A good example of this stupidity, is punishing students whom went out at nights, by sending them out at nights in the dark forest, where they can get attacked by creatures. The most insulting thing in logic is the black/white one-dimensional view of good Vs evil. Honestly, how on earth is the members of Slytherin never got expulsion for all the bullies that it has? You would think, that at less, there would be one good person in Slytherin. Another thing that bugs me is the whole the power of love conquer all. I think, children are a lot smarter than the childish message, the film is trying to pull. The acting in the movie is pretty bland, for the most part. After all, most of the child actors had this film as their first roles. I wouldn't say that Harry Potter's film series, have the most entertaining of dialogues, anyways. The wooden delivery, felt like a read-through. Most of what they're saying are stating the obvious or repeating what happening on screen. It's so annoying. The other actors were master British thespians, who seem to over-act at times. A good example of this is John Hurt & Alan Rickman. It was too hammy for already over the top world. The action scenes were pretty well-done. My favorite had to be the Quidditch match and the whole chess game. I can do, without the whole troll scene. The CGI troll hasn't aged well. Visually, the movie is beautiful to look at. I love the special effects, locations & set, and costume, they did. It really made the Harry Potter world, stand out. The music by John Williams is amazing to listen to. I think director Chris Columbus was indeed the best choice for this first movie, as he got the magically part, right and how to make a family picture. You even see, how much things, he establish that other directors would reused time after time. Still, I really hope for Terry Gilliam like J.K Rowling's first choice to be the direction. The movie has great social commentary themes like the metaphor of racism, ethnic cleansing and why Nazism is bad. You can also see possible influences from other words, that made Harry Potter work. There was a few controversial moments leading up to the film, like religious debates. A few religious groups claim that Harry Potter contain occult or Satanic subtexts that isn't good for children. Another one is the use of the word, sorcerer over the word philosopher in the title. US & British have different meanings to the words, plus marketing though, it would better to call it sorcerer as that word get more appeal. Due to this different, all scenes that mention the philosopher's stone by name had to be reshot, once with the actors saying \"philosopher's\" and once with \"sorcerer's\". Overall: The movie might has its flaws, but majority, a great first watch for any fantasy fan.\n",

In only one movie, we've seen amazing creatures, friendly and foes, teachers that are heroes and villains, we've witnessed the wisdom of the legendary professor Dumbldor, the movie made us guess who will be who and on who's side in the chapters to come and above all, we had fun. I will never forget the part where Harry buys all the things he needs to start his wizard journey, the authentic look of the streets, the shops and the bank will be part of the Harry Potter legacy forever.\n",
            "Rating: , Review: To be faced with the challenge of adapting Harry Potter for the Silver screen must have been any director's nightmare- the chance of directing possibly the biggest film of this decade, but also the hardest audience-the millions of fans of the book who know every line and will pick up on every mistake. Being one of the above, I can only say that Christopher Columbus and all of the team working on HP did marvelously. The cast was brilliant (particularly notable are Alan Rickman as Snape, Maggie Smith as McGonagall, and the eerily creepy David Bradley as Argus Filch), the directing wonderful, and the scenery perfect. The only qualm is that it does not track perfectly with the book, but squeezed into 2.5 hours, this can only be expected. Well done all involved!\n",

I watch it every time it's on TV, and there is one channel that shows all the series of this incredible movie every time after the new year. I also want to mention that even my family members like to watch it with me. My grandmother especially likes it. This fact indicates that this movie is interesting not only for children but also for elderly people and it's not weird for me. There are so many things going on in this movie, so many secrets and beautiful scenes. Plus a big thanks for the graphics of the movie, everything is very realistic. For example, the mermaids or the dinosaurs. Moreover, there is a massive animatronic creature in this movie- spider and after watching the movie google about it and found out that Rupert Grint, the actor who plays Ron Weasley, one of the main characters, is afraid of spiders just s much as his character is, and said it was easily the scariest scenes to film. I'm scared of spiders too, and I know how it feels when you see them. Thus, I really appreciate the job that this actor did. In my opinion, despite the fact that he had to play again a guy, who was scaring from spiders, it is again hard to play the role by looking at the creature that gives you goosebumps. Thus, this movie not only good in graphics, but also the cast.\n",

It's a delight to watch, I've seen this movie numerous times and it never fails to make me smile, to cheer me up when I'm feeling down, the Harry Potter franchise is magical both inside and out, and it's simple fun to watch Harry go in to his first year at Hogwarts, the story's quite simple as the series kicks off with a light start, but it will still leave you wanting more. The films biggest flaw is, at times, it is too faithful to the book that it is based off, I'm sure this is pleasing for anyone who's read the book, but for those who haven't it tends to drag out at times, more than an hour passes before Potter even goes to Hogwarts and the main adventure dosen't unfold properly until at least one hundred minutes in, it can get a little tedious at times and that's why I'm giving it an eight instead of a nine that it easily could have received. The cast is outstanding, the young cast members are ridiculously talented for their age, Daniel Radcliffe seems to have no trouble playing a lead role, and both Rupert Grint and Emma Watson shine as his closest friends, they never lose a single bit of likability. They are joined by a terrific adult cast, including the likes of Alan Rickman, Maggie Smith, Robbie Coltrane and, the highlight of the movie for me, Richard Harris, he shines as Professor Dumbledore (sadly only for two movies), his characterization is perfect, he is wise, heartwarming and simply a lovable character. It may be a bit slow at times, but Harry Potter and the Philiosopher's Stone never loses its sense of fun and magic, and because of this it is a perfect film for the whole family to watch and enjoy. \n",

            "Rating: 8, Review: All the Harry Potter films in this series are pretty good. Some are better than others, but over-all, the seven together is quite a motion picture experience. This one is the first one in the series and is the best one to get started with. This first film is so well produced, that it should satisfy you enough to watch even more of them. This film also works on its own. That is good, in case, you never get a chance to see another one again in your life. Start with the first one I always say. Being the first film also means, I have seen it the most. I saw this film as soon as it landed on DVD, then when I realized there would be a seven or eight film run on the Harry Potter series, i stopped watching them and waited for all of them to be released in a DVD package, which I finally finished in 2017. This film still works great today as it did 20 years ago.\n",

            "Rating: 8, Review: I have seen this movie numerous times on TV, but I was never able to watch it in it's entirety some reason until today where I managed to watch it all and it did not disappoint. The story is just really intriguing right from the start where you introduced to the character Harry Potter who is just very likeable which makes you root for him against his so called family. The world of Hogwarts is amazing and makes you want to wish it was a real place. The story is easy to follow and it's not predictable which I liked as there are a few twists which just make the movie even more thrilling. I have seen bits of the other movies on TV as well and I hope they are as good if not better as this.\n",
            "Rating: 8, Review: Sorcerer stone is a pretty good film which introduces us with harry potter and his friends. Just like the kids in Hogwarts, audience are also in awe with the magic. But I felt that this lacked a story which is only revealed towards end. But still this is my second most favorite harry potter film after chamber of secrets.\n",

            "Rating: 5, Review: It was amazing to watch how a huge movie franchise started with this one. It showed a basis for the entire Harry Potter timeline. The visual effects were very great for this film. It was on-point and did not feel amateurish. Unfortunately for me, everything else was a bit stale and unexciting. I was in doubt of whether it really maximized its runtime. There were, in some parts, too many scenes which the characters were doing a lot of dialogues. The production design and costumes were excellent aspects of the film, too. But for me a lot of dark cinematography was utilized, instead of a more lively kind of production.\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is what a book adaptation should be. The only things left out of the movie were very minor. This tells the story of a boy whose parents were killed when he was young and been mistreated by his aunt and uncle. He receives a letter about a school named Hogwarts. There, in his first year with his friends Ron and Hermione, he must stop wrongdoing of a couple teachers. The cast was wonderfully casted. Daniel Radcliffe is fantastic and looks the part of Harry. Everyone else is perfect. As I mentioned above, the adaptation is great. The movie even used the same quotations as the books. The music is memorable. I liked John William's Hedwig Theme. The costumes are good-looking and so is everything else. This movie will leave a magical imprint on your minds and this is only the first film. I rate this magical adventure 10/10.\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: I have recently been revisiting the Harry Potter franchise during the ongoing pandemic and I have been wondering whether these movie that I hadn't seen in a decade would have aged well or not. My conclusion is that most of them have aged particularly well and this is especially the case for the first two movies that I consider the best of the franchise. The producers' idea to hire veteran director Chris Columbus was certainly a decisive one in hindsight since he managed to transform a first novel with numerous lengths into an extremely entertaining film for the entire family.\n",

I love all the movies and books.\n",

            "Rating: 3, Review: I have, in all my life as a lover of both literature and the cinema, hardly ever come upon a piece of work more unimaginative, more ugly, more uninteresting, more lacking in suspense, more lacking in charm, more greedy, more incoherent... Okay, okay. I'll stop with the superlative negatives. Surely there have been worse, and, yes, off the top of my head, I can think of many that are worse. However, for a book that over 125 million people have read, and for a movie that cemented the record for the biggest opening weekend in history, and also for a book that has had not only kids but critics singing its praises, and also for a movie which one particularly fat-headed critic called the Wizard of Oz of its generation, I am more than severely disappointed. I know that, had it not been so overhyped, it would have been just as bad. Now, however, my anger for it is completely hardened and it's going to be a passionate battle for me for years to come.\n",

It was released around the time I was born, and I can't really ever remember a time when it wasn't my favorite world to escape into. Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone is the first book I can remember becoming a fan of, and wanting to read it again straight away. I'm not even going to pretend that I can judge this without bringing over my fondness for the books.\n",
            "Rating: 7, Review: While I look back on this first entry into the Harry Potter series fondly it is not with out a few problems with adaption from the books. Our trio of main actors are very young and as a result we get plently of chessey acting. Looking back however it is great too see the beginning roots of the characters that we get very attached too through out the series. We get too see them grow as actors. A great cast was put together that stayed more or less the same through out the whole franchise. The effects in the movie are handled well for its time despite Harry not actually using any magic. Even though there are better movies in the series I will always look forward to watching this entry.\n",
            "Rating: 6, Review: Not being a reader of the Harry Potter books, I came to the first Harry Potter movie with a totally open mind. There seems to be those who love the book but hate the film; those that love both; and even a few who hate both! Having watched Harry Potter And The Sorcerer's Stone, I must confess that I'm not entirely sure what all the fuss is about. This strikes me as solid but unremarkable, totally overlong but fairly diverting fare.\n",

By now, the Harry Potter books have become so well entrenched in our culture that I don't even need to explain the story. But I can say that director Chris Columbus did a great job adapting the book to the silver screen.\n",
            "Rating: , Review: Well, for starters, the older cast, almost all of whom are instantly recognizable if you've seen much of British television or film, are simply delightful in their roles, with special honors going to Alan Rickman as Professor Snape, Richard Harris as Albus Dumbledore, and Robbie Coltrane as Rubeus Hagrid. Some other positive aspects to the film is that it is a faithful adaptation for the most part, and the child actors certainly aren't the worst I've ever seen. Moreover, John Williams' brilliant score was at the time one of the best in years.\n",
            "Rating: 8, Review: This first Harry Potter surprised me. Not a reader of the books nor a proponent of occult beliefs, I still went into this with an open mind and found I enjoyed the movie. I watched the first three films and own the third (\"Harry Potter and Prisoner Of Azkaban\").\n",
            "Rating: 8, Review: Of all the Harry Potter's movies, I guess the ''Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone'' was the more more expected of all. I was one of the thousands of teenagers who wanted to watch this movie so badly and I watched it in the first week it came here in Brazil. After 4 Harry Potter's movies, now I feel comfortable to say that the first movie is the one I liked the least. Maybe because it is the one who has less adventure or danger of all, but I cannot say exactly why. I think it will be very difficult for me, being crazy for Harry Potter's books, to give 10 in any of the H.P.'s movies, since the book is SO MUCH better than any of the films. I mean, MANY great parts are never showed in the movies. But if you are one of those people who never read any Harry Potter book, this film will be of vital importance to watch since it is the first of the series.\n",
            "Rating: 8, Review: \"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\" or sometimes also \"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone\" is the first film from one of the most successful movie franchises in cinema history. The books were written by Joanne K. Rowling and adapted by Steve Kloves (not a name to many), who also directed \"The Fabulous Baker Boys\" earlier in his career. It is about a small boy with hidden powers, who is not particularly liked by his uncle, aunt and cousin. They took care of him after his parents died when he was a baby. So he gets picked up by an unusually looking, rather gruff magician and taken to Hogwarts. Hogwarts is not a normal school. While the bonding with fellow students, the fraternities and sports activities are there as well, everything is just a little bit more magical and different.\n",

And then, I will tell my story. I will begin with the positives to be nice. To be generous.\n",

            "Rating: , Review: I was drawn into the story the moment the letters started whirling through the air to \"the boy under the cupboard\" and to the amusing trio (Aunt, Uncle, brother) that give interest to the early scenes and make you anxious for Harry to escape life in this demented household. And from the opening scene on, the special effects are nothing short of marvelous despite what some \"critics\" here are calling \"cheesy\" -- I'm sure the film is a strong contender in that category for a Best Special Effects Oscar.\n",
            "Rating: 8, Review: \"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone\" is the first movie in the Harry Potter franchise, based on the popular book series by J. K. Rowling.

            "Rating: 7, Review: Orphaned not long after his birth, \"Harry Potter\" (Daniel Radcliffe) is forced to live in the home of his only living relatives who treat him rather badly. That all changes one day when he is informed by a man named \"Rebeus Hagrid\" (Robbie Coltrane) that his parents were famous magicians and because of that he is invited to attend the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Needless to say, Harry accepts almost immediately and after Hagrid and he buy the necessary school equipment he begins his journey to the mystical academy. It's then that he meets two fellow students named \"Ron Weasley\" (Rupert Grint) and \"Hermione Granger\" (Emma Watson) who become his good friends and share in his triumphs and travails. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this film was based on the very successful book \"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone\" by J.K. Rowling and from what I understand remains quite faithful to the book. At least for the most part. In any case, I found it to be a fine fantasy film with the interaction between Harry and his two friends especially entertaining. Admittedly, there are some slow parts here and there and it does run a bit long (152 minutes). Even so, despite the faults just mentioned, I believe this to be one of those rare movies which can be enjoyed by the entire family and I have rated it accordingly. Above average.\n",

            "Rating: 4, Review: I know I'm probably the only one that didn't care for this film, but I thought it was plain boring. The adaptation of the book is just OK and the acting is average. Frankly it's a pity to see all the great English actors in this film totally wasted and relegated to play second fiddle. The effects are very well done, but it's such a conventional treatment of the books that I kept checking my watch a few times to see when was it going to be over. It's very curious that hardly any of the young people in the audience didn't laugh at all. This Harry Potter is very heavy handed and it should have emphasized the fun and could have used a few lighter moments.\n",
            "Rating: 1, Review: Literally anyone could write this story. Nothing is original, the effects are mostly bad, the acting is bad, the direction is bad and the music score was written by John Williams 25 years ago (if you get my meaning).\n",
            "Rating: 9, Review: If you watch \"Sorcerer's Stone\" without reading the book first, there are certain narrative points that you will miss or not quite be as clear on (as usual). However, watching the movie closely following the reading experience will actually expand upon the Potter myth (I gave the first book four stars) due to this film's ability to lay the groundwork of the series in such stunning visuals and characters.\n",
            "Rating: 5, Review: With billions upon billions of pounds in revenue generated from book sales, film adaptations and all other mediums, and with the hysteria surrounding the series now all but gone, it seemed the perfect time to re-visit the Harry Potter film franchise. I'll state outright that I'm a fan of the books: they are hardly ground-breaking pieces of literature, but they are a meticulously crafted and widely imaginative set of novels, maturing with it's progression and with the age of it's characters and readers. The movie adaptations were consistently average, fiercely loyal to J.K. Rowling's prose but always somewhat lacking in substance.\n",

            "Rating: 9, Review: My sister and I, back when I was ten, wouldn't even go near anything Harry Potter-related, despite its immense popularity at the time; we'd call Harry Potter \"Hairy Pothead\" and laugh at the nerdy glasses he wore on the book and DVD covers. Anyway, recently we decided it was time to see what made Harry Potter fans so raving mad over a little boy with superpowers and a geeky school uniform, and it was a nerdy children's movie but not nearly as bad as we thought! The main character, Harry, is a seemingly average boy living in the U.K. with his aunt, uncle, and spoiled overweight cousin, Dudley (great name choice). When Harry begins discovering strange powers in himself, his aunt and uncle do everything in THEIR power to keep the truth a secret from him, but when Harry finds out he's a wizard and is given an invite to a secluded boarding school for wizards and witches, he eagerly accepts, wanting to be with kids like himself. From there he picks up two misfit friends, meets a snotty rival with way too much gel in his bleached hair, and meets a variety of teachers, including a perverse, hawk-like old guy with emo hair and a hooked nose.\n",
            "Rating: 1, Review: My sister, bless her heart, used to work in a bookstore, and brought the novel this turkey is based upon home one day. After everyone else in my family had read it, I decided to give it a go because I had little better to do at the time. I wound up throwing the book across the room in around thirty pages, feeling that not only had my intelligence been insulted, so too had the already-persecuted-enough faiths of Wicca and its pagan relatives.\n",
            "Rating: 1, Review: Why all the glowing comments?  This is one lame movie.  Haven't we seen these types of special effects enough already?  The acting was lame.  The story was lame.  The pace was slow.  The scenes overly long and trite.  I was bored out of my mind.  \n",
            "Rating: 9, Review: Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is not a perfect film, but it is a magical film. The franchise has been a large part of my life for most of my life.

            "Rating: 1, Review: Cut about an hour out of the middle of HARRY POTTER and you'll have a pretty decent little movie.  As is, it's a bloated mess.  There's no heart to this, no characterizations.  It's just a product reel for all the special effects companies that worked on it.\n",
            "Rating: 6, Review: I love the Harry Potter books because of their brilliant writing, exciting and funny moments, compelling characters and the way that I'm hooked as soon as I pick one up. They deserved to be such a phenomenon. The films? Not so much. This starts off the adaptations in OK style, and follows Harry Potter's attempts to stop the evil sorcerer who killed his parents getting a stone which will help him return to power.\n",
            "Rating: 8, Review: 'Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone' is one of the most entertaining films I know. You can look at it and not worry about anything because you know it will all be alright. Very true to the book it reaches the same level. Daniel Radcliffe is the perfect Harry Potter, Emma Watson a great Hermione and Rupert Grint a very funny Ron Weasly. With the famous story, a great direction from 'Home Alone'-director Chris Columbus, a perfect casting and some nice special effects this is the way a movie like this has to be. Be entertained by the world of the wizards.\n",
            "Rating: 8, Review: This was such a brilliantly done film. Well Harry Potter is a brilliantly done franchise in general. But the Sorcerers Stone (or Philosophers Stone) is a well done beginning for this franchise. The character development in this franchise is absolutely fantastic. You get instantly attached to the main and side characters instantly. All the actors did a great job and gave funny and fun performances. The overall feel of this movie is so magical and has such a fun feel. I have never seen a movie World get you so attached more quickly then Harry Potter. Overall this film was awesome and I highly recommend it.\n",

Throughout my life - school days, college, internet; I often used to see people going non-stop about Harry Potter (I think they are called Potterheads). Harry Potter this, Harry Potter that.

I hope he does another Harry Potter movie or Percy Jackson movie cause he has a better imagination like Peter Jackson.\n",
            "Rating: 8, Review: What else can I say about the world of Harry Potter that hasn't been said already? After the first book came out, everyone was going crazy for Harry Potter. But then Potterheads minds were blown when in 2001, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone was released. The film was directed by Chris Columbus and stars Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, Emma Watson, John Cleese, Robbie Coltrane, Warwick Davis, Richard Griffiths, Richard Harris, Ian Hart, John Hurt, Alan Rickman, Fiona Shaw, Maggie Smith, and Julie Walters. The film was a huge success financially and critically and luckily won fans of the books over and continued with seven more films plus three spinoff films.\n",
            "Rating: 9, Review: How sad it is to begin the reader's comments with a whining, complaining, drone against everything about this movie. Why not pick a balanced view. Good grief! Did someone poison your dog? It made it sound like this doesn't compare favorably with \"Hamburger: The Movie.\" I am a over fifty years old and thought I would be pretty lukewarm to a \"kids\" movie. I have been listening for a year to kids raving about the Harry Potter books. Their eyes light up--they are enthused about a \"book.\" When I went to see it, I had just read the book the night before because I like to see how they translate. The script was delightful. The characters were charming. The acting in this movie is wonderful--were you expecting Bergman? The pacing is delightful. The sets are eerie and forbidding. I thought that the wonderment of the characters was there in full force. Who did you have in mind to play Harry? Are there any actors that you approve of? Perhaps Kevin Spacy should have played Harry. How about the blond girl from American Beauty as Hermione. Johnny Depp as Ron Weasley. Oh yeah--as I recall, Stephen Spielberg has made a couple of pretty decent movies.\n",
            "Rating: 1, Review: I don`t rate JK Rowling as a writer so when the hype machine stated that HARRY POTTER AND THE PHILOSOPHER`S STONE ( As it`s called in Britain ) was going to be faithful to the book I thought this was a film that wasn`t worth seeing but I decided to give it a chance , after all I hadn`t expected much from THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING but I ended up falling in love with Peter Jackson`s beautiful masterpiece . But after watching THE PHILOSOPHER`S STONE my instincts had been proved right and in many ways the film had lived down to expectations .\n",

            "Rating: 10, Review: You know what?  I'm getting sick of reading comments by people who are tearing this movie apart, saying it twists mythology, it is unimaginative, it is done simply for cold cash, etc..  Well, a lot of these people are the same ones who will go see the same action movie over and over again, despite the lack of plot and talent.  Hollywood just does not make good family movies anymore that are not animated, and I think that is very well done. The child actors are wonderful and have great timing for actors of their age.  Just enjoy it!\n",
            "Rating: 6, Review: If you don't know your Potter (like me), than you might have a problem with the titles. With other series, it's easier to distinguish, which one is part 1, 2, 3 etc. etc. Even the Naked Gun series which has Parts 2 and half and 33 and a third, you still know the order (not of the Phoenix obviously!) ;o) \n",
            "Rating: 7, Review: Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, based on the novel it seems every kid has read (to my surprise considering that I hated reading most books as a kid, especially ones that looked longer than 200 pages and had little or no pictures but then I'm not a kid anymore) is now a movie and while it is certainly overrated and sometimes stupid, it gives some decent moments of entertainment.  It is another film that will depend on the viewer on how much he/she can take with near non-stop adventure and (impressive) visual effects.  It's a wonder the film made 93 million in one weekend (isn't that a sign of biblical armageddon though), but since the film is directed a lot more at kids it's not a total surprise since the movie gets a big reccomendation in the family film department.  But teens and adults might not want to walk in the theater prepared to see the greatest film since Wizard of Oz like the kids are.  \n",
            "Rating: 7, Review: There were many plot changes to accommodate the adaptation of this literary work to film. But what bothered me more were the obvious comparisons to the 1986 TV movie \"The Worst Witch,\" in which many of the main characters of this work seem to have appeared. \n",
            "Rating: 8, Review: Harry Potter seems to highlight what today's society is missing; the age of magical innocence, the pure abandonment of that essence of childhood. In this day and age of computer games and quick fix takeaway electronic happiness and incessant CGI violence, it's brilliant to see the world excited by story telling and the simple things. It reminds me of years ago as a child reading volumes of Roald Dahl's compositions and hanging out to read the next chapter of 'Danny the Champion of the World'. Harry Potter has engaged the world back into that innocence, even if it is for a two hour movie.\n",
            "Rating: 6, Review: Lacking any real magic, Harry Potter was a lifeless film, composed of a plotless story and forgettable performances. While watching the Neverending Story last night, a true children's classic, it really hit me how wonderful a movie Harry Potter could have been if only they'd been willing to deviate from the book for a second.\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: When the movie first came out, I was hesitant about seeing it because I was so enamored of the J.K. Rowling book. Therefore, I avoided it at the theater. When I finally bought the DVD I was sorry I hadn't seen it at the theater as I found that the movie was a truly worthy adaptation of the book. \n",

            "Rating: 5, Review: One of my favorite books, unfortunately the movie doesn't keep up to the standards. Also disheartened by mediocre performance by the main actor, Ron and Hermione are really good though. Did not like the actors caster for Fred and George as really doesn't go with the impression one would get of those two from the book.\n",
            "Rating: 3, Review: Hurrendous! Daniel Radcliffe absolutely destroys this film. He has no experience and he loves and enjoys himself far too much for anyone else to enjoy the film. The facial expressions, the looks and the lack of acting capability was so tragic it wasn't funny! Emma Watson and Rupert Grint gave decent performances. And Maggie SMith ruled supreme. A few good moments but the lead star dragged the film down so much it was unbearably bad! Sorry a 3. Plot was pathetic and Daniel wrecked it!\n",
            "Rating: 7, Review: Who hasn't fantasized about receiving a letter of acceptance from Hogwarts? The author and the filmmakers are too good, and they have created a whole new world.What attracts me most is the charm and novelty of magic, the magical 9 and 3/4 platform, the wonderful magic school, the lively small partners and so on, all of which make me surprised and surprised.\n",

            "Rating: 7, Review: Before I entered the cinema I was a little worried that the book may have been picked up and messed around with by the Hollywood machine and the film pushed out the end, But to my amazement they have kept almost the same. Several little bits were missing, like the absence of the poltergeist which I thought may have been quite fun. But a mystic magical adventure not to be missed!\n",
            "Rating: , Review: I've read all the Harry Potter books and really liked them. This movie pales in comparison to the books.  Too much is left out of the movie, especially the ending.  The book shows how all 3 kids overcome the challenges by doing what they are good at. And the movie leaves some of that out.  The kids were awful actors.  They must have cast the cheapest kids they could find.\n",
            "Rating: 5, Review: This film is by all means a classic, but classic does not mean great. Though the set design and camera work (not specifically cinematography but rather how the camera moved through scenes) and editing was great. That film as a whole does not deserve as much credit as it gets.\n",
            "Rating: 6, Review: I'm not really a big fan of the HP films. I don't think that they translate well from the books as they are often quite long and need severe cutting down in order to fit into a 2 hour+ film. This has been increasingly evident in the later HP sequels, but Philosopher's Stone seems to be pretty much all intact.\n",

I felt the same exact nostalgia as I did when i very first saw it! This film adaptation of J.K. Rowling's novel is VERY accurate! Nearly every scene and every line from the novel is in this movie! If you're one who LOVES film adaptations of books then Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is definitely for you!!! As well as the 7 sequels of the film series are also very accurate to the books. Give this magical movie a watch!!!.\n",

            "Rating: 8, Review: I was very impressed by Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. I had read the book a year prior to the film release and was very impressed by how close the film was to the book, only skipping a few things for time. The things the movie skipped on wasn't enough to make the film unworthy to watch.\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: This is not a film, it is a trap door to a life, we all wanted to live in when we were kids. It's been years since I had watched the first chapter of JK Rowling wizarding world, I wanted to review with utmost passion and dedication but my thoughts, feelings never inked on the words.\n",

            "Rating: 10, Review: I was quite surprised to see that this movie only rated around 6.5. So it begs the question, exactly how enjoyable, clever, truly magical and unique does a fantasy movie have to be to rate close to or specifically a \"10\"?\n",
            "Rating: 1, Review: It's a movie made for people who think that magic is cute and fun.  If you're a fantasy fan like I am, and believe in magic (in a fictional sense) then you may very well detest this movie, as I did.  Magic comes easily to little Harry Potter, who has no personality to speak of except that he is occasionally sad that he never met his mum and dad.  Years of abuse and neglect have left not a mark on him, so when he gets invited to Hogwarts Academy of Magic, he has nowhere for his character to go.  There he flies around on his broomstick and gets to be a big hero quite by accident without ever confronting any serious obstacles or anything resembling a plot.  In all this, the film is an excellent adaptation of the book, which also thought that magic is cutesy wootesy.\n",
            "Rating: 6, Review: 'Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone' no doubt divided many fans of the 'Harry Potter' novels, of whom I am one. The film adaptation of a much loved book was never going to please everyone and, while it is an enjoyable way to spend a couple of hours, there is no denying that it has both good and bad points.\n",
            "Rating: 7, Review: Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone is the first of eight films based on the seven best selling novels by J.K. Rowling. While I certainly don't think it is one of the better films, it is the one that starts them off and crucially it does so in the right way.\n",
            "Rating: 9, Review: The day I went to see this movie in the cinema I can remember very well. The film was from 2001 and in those days I was 7, so it was one of the first movie's I saw in cinema. If you are the young you can't remember anything so a movie must make a very good impression on you. If it wants to be good. There was one scene in this first movie that I will never forget. It made such a big impression on me. It was were my love for Harry Potter started. Hogwarts was in a way a safe place for me, and the magic really hit me. And it still does today. This scene that impressed me so much was when the audience could see Hogwarts for the very first time on screen. You just saw this massive castle, in that was so impressive; I actually can't put it into world how enthusiastic I was. The children were sitting in the boats effortlessly and were floating over the water. The castle had something magical and I was sure I would never forget it.\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: In many ways the best of the franchise so far. I was free from any anticipation for this film being not overly impressed by the fantasy genre. This film redeems itself above other sorcery films with its old fashioned English ambiance being greater than arch and portentous fantasy.\n",
            "Rating: 8, Review: A classic is a classic. You can't get enough of it. The magical magic school really thought it existed before, and especially envied the students who could study at the magic school. Harry Potter is kind and brave and fights Voldemort with his friends. The little actors in it are so cute\n",
            "Rating: 8, Review: Despite being part of the generation that grew up with these books/films I was never particularly a big fan of Harry Potter the way so many others were. I saw the films on TV every now and then and found them mildly entertaining but they never managed to truly win me over. At the time I was more of a fan of the lesser appreciated Chronicles of Narnia series of films.\n",

            "Rating: 10, Review: I reviewed this film about a year ago when I had seen it for the first time and I said that I liked the book more but the more I see this film I have discovered that I like the movie just as much as the book.  I think that Harry Potter is such a great book and movie series.  I personally love the fact that they started making the movies because now along with my visualizations that I have, I also have the visualizations that go along with the movie.  I can't wait until Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban(my favorite out of all the books) comes out, I believe that it will be the coolest book to see on the big screen.\n",
            "Rating: 7, Review: The first Harry Potter movie is also one of the best in the series, partly because it sticks to it's source material. Columbus doesn't try to condense the movie to make it more appealing to non-fans but instead pleases the already enormous Harry Potter fanbase with a faithful rendition of the HP world. \n",
            "Rating: 8, Review: Sure, the special effects are somewhat dated and the lead trio's performances are still to be improved. Nevertheless it's easy to see how the first movie charmed audiences worldwide with its sense of awe, wonder and joy. With a horrifying villain and complex central mystery, 'Sorcerer's Stone' is an easy film to recommend, with scenes that remain iconic to this day and a simple 'dark vs light' dynamic that works very well.\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: Pretty decent movie but I think the book is better\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: This film is the best kids film ever and I never get tired of watching. It just gives that warm fuzzy feeling inside and I'm smiling like an idiot throughout. Each time I see it i notice something different. Thanks to JK Rowling for giving me and my son a bond for life. I can't imagine a life without Harry Potter in it.\n",
            "Rating: 8, Review: There is a major difference between reviews here and this is very easy to explain. Anybody who (like me) has read the books multiple times, knowing the slightest details and loving absolutely everything from the series, can´t be completely happy with the film. For the neutral watcher who read the books maybe once or not even at all this movie must seem like a really entertaining and well directed film. The problem is that though very good acting, especially Alan Rickman as Snape, a beautiful scenery and very good camera work, the most important essentials of the books are pretty much non-existing. For instance, I, as an hardcore fan since the first time reading the books when i was 9, was always extremely interested in reading a passage of a normal school lesson or a normal day at any job of an fully educated wizard, eg in the ministry of magic. Rowling made us have the desire to always experience more of the universe she created. I was always amazed by the lightness and uncomplicated way of Rowlings writing, how she managed to let us accompany Harry in his daily life, making the actually extremely strange and funny way of the magicians life seem so normal and casual for the readers. The film on the other hand is more of a build-up to Harry´s first encounter with Voldemort, a scene that´s perfectly directed with impressive effects and good filming, which is definitely the highlight of as well film and book, with the difference that the book is more focused in describing Harry´s adventrous first year as a whole. The film is a little bit inconsistent in terms of how close it sticks to the book´s plot and this is another problem. Because of the book being so comprehensive and full it is nearly impossible not to skip any sections of the book. In my opinion the screenwriter should have either sticked closer to the book or distanced the filmplot more from it. Another thing i miss is the great dry humour the book is spiced with in a lot of ways. The problem is that this can´t really be translated in the movie because it´s often in the way Rowling describes things and not only in the dialogues. One thing that is awesome is the music. In my opinion John Williams is the best film music composer and the way he captures the mysterious and thrilling atmosphere and the majesty and greatness of Hogwarts is marvelous. At the end I can say that the film can meet the expectations but it´s just not possible to convince a haerdore fan completely, just because while reading the book, everybody creates his own picture of Hogwarts, the characters and the scenery. This is called imagination, it is the best part of reading a book, not possible to be translated completetly satisfyingly into a movie and the reason to my big recommandation concerning Harry Potter and also every other book which is filmed. Read the book first! If you watch the film first and read the books afterwards you´ll miss a great time imagining everything for yourself. And this will come espescially pronounced in the books of Harry Potter.\n",
            "Rating: 6, Review: This movie was my first introduction to Harry Potter. Seeing it in the theater with a few of my cousins, I didn't know what to expect. What I got was a fairly enjoyable, though overlong, movie that kept me interested until the end. I was pleasantly surprised by the surprise ending; I remember going through the film thinking about the one dimensional plot, and I actually didn't see the ending coming.\n",
            "Rating: 8, Review: 'Harry Potter And The Philosopher's Stone (2001)' is starting to show its age in a few areas - though, the majority of special effects still hold up remarkably well. The young actors have certainly come a long way since this first outing, but this is still an entertaining and endearing experience that's as enchanting as it is exciting. It does a great job of setting up the vibrant 'wizarding world' of which we're all now so familiar, it has some fantastically interesting concepts and well-executed ideas and it is surprisingly funny at times, too. While it may now be perhaps the 'worst' in the series, aside from the 'Fantastic Beasts' spin-off stuff (which doesn't really count, of course), it is still a wonderfully charming and enjoyable ride that's better than most of today's blockbusters. 8/10\n",
            "Rating: 1, Review: I have never read the book this film is supposed to be based on, therefore, I can only judge this movie by itself. And there is not much to judge. I quit after 40 minutes or so and I have no regrets. The acting is ... well, it's not there. The script is a fairy tale, which takes itself way too seriously, making the story as dull and predictable as possible. The camera work is so standard, you can predict the angle of the next shot. What can I say - I just hope the book is better, since many kids like it. I would have given it 3 out of 10, but the wasted budget and the hype take their toll... 1 out of 10. A disgrace.\n",
            "Rating: 1, Review: **SPOILERS**Before I briefly state my views, I must confess that I have never read a word of or even picked up a Harry Potter book in all of my life. I had many friends rave and rant about them, and at my work, I often see my co-worker's kids sitting in corners, waiting for their mothers to take them to school, reading the latest chapter in the series enthusiastically. But because I have never read Harry Potter myself, I have no understanding of the series, the characters, or the plotlines outside of the world this movie has created. Therefore, this is a review for viewers like me: They haven't read the books, and they're curious to see what all the hype is about.\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: I've read all four (to date) of J.K. Rowling's excellent HARRY POTTER novels.  As an 18-year old American college student, I'm far from the target audience for this movie, but I went to see it on opening day in hopes that it would live up to its source material.\n",
            "Rating: 7, Review: The Harry Potter series has always been my favorite magic movie. I am a fan of Emma Watson, and I watch every movie of hers. I love Hermione so much. It is a pity that this movie was not seen in the cinema. The storyline is very restored to the novel, continuing the level of the previous few\n",
            "Rating: 1, Review: I don't read Harry Potter and never intend to. I wasn't even going to see the movie but my conniving and manipulative friend tricked me into seeing it (long story; you wouldn't want to hear it). Needless to say, I did not like the movie, although my 11-year-old brother loved it to death.\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: Harry Potter is a child left at the door of his uncles' house after the early death of his parents by a bearded old man, a small giant and a cat woman when he was just a baby. He is a green-eyed boy who wears split glasses and has messy black hair. He also had a special feature, a ray-shaped scar on his forehead. The uncles hated him and treated him very badly. He slept in a cupboard under the stairs and was constantly badly treated by his fat cousin. One day they went to the zoo and Harry trying to talk to a snake made the glass disappear without knowing how.\n",
            "Rating: 1, Review: I have not and have no intention of reading the books- nothing against them, they just aren't my cup o'tea. I hesitated seeing this film not because of no interest in those books- but because of the director- I have found his films to be trite and cheap and very formula- straight from the Speilberg school of \"once I've made my first ba-zillion I can sell out and never have to be creative again\". This film has good camera work. It has current state effects. It has a pace akin to running a 24fps film at 1000fps. It's shallow- it asks you to buy into all of it without explanation. There's a fakeness to it leaving me feeling like I had molten Saran-wrap poured over me. I don't care about the characters because they were simply place-holders- no personalities. Harry is so two-dimensional as to make a sheet of paper more intriguing. Perhaps the \"genre\" just doesn't appeal here. Fans (and most people are either a fan or not- no \"in-betweens\") ballyhoo this film with that glazed-eye look of cult religionists. Yuck.\n",

            "Rating: 6, Review: So, to set the scene a little bit, I believe this is the third time I've seen this movie. I read the nearly all the books when they came out and watched just the first one when it released and then, over lockdown pounded out the whole series. Thought I'd come back to it again and give it a more critical eye.\n",
            "Rating: 7, Review: Harry potter is a pretty good movie. It has fine cgi, very good world building lovable characters, great acting, etc. The only real problem with the movie is the drawn out ending, which was super boring and filled with plot holes.\n",

            "Rating: 7, Review: This one of the best book to movie adaptation than anything else\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: This movie brought us into a world of fantasy, good, and evil.  It remained true to the book in spirit and stayed pretty close in fact.  The world created by Rowling and put to the screen by Columbus had secrets all over that we slowly discover with Harry.  I rated this a 10 not because it is a perfect movie, but because it is better than 95% of all others I've seen. And it was nice to take a break from reality and realize that not even wizards have fun all the time.  Though, I would love to try out the Nimbus 2000 just once.\n",
            "Rating: , Review: First let me say I have not read any Harry Potter books, and I think that is an advantage to enjoying these Harry Potter films. Second, let me say I am a Christian and a grandfather, and I found the witchcraft not one bit troubling.  It's a movie, after all, and in the end \"love\" is the main quality Harry Potter is credited with.\n",
            "Rating: 6, Review: The first chapter of the saga is boring and too much for children, for heaven's sake it must be for children, but in my opinion it is too stupid and senseless and therefore it is a film that is too naive and boring at times.\n",
            "Rating: 7, Review: The first time I saw harry potter and the sorcerer's stone, I was attracted by the boy wizard who was studying magic at the wizarding academy and flying around on a broom. The harry potter movies, fantastic beasts are there, so classic, at home is not always out to review. I can't say that I know 100 percent of rowling's wizarding world, but I love being immersed in it in movies.\n",
            "Rating: 4, Review: At times, it seems the only objective the director has is presenting \"Harry Potter magical things\" one after the other and that's it. There is no story. The movie is nothing, really. It expects us to be amazed by the score. And the score is great, but no. It doesn't work. And that's more than an hour.\n",
            "Rating: 1, Review: Children's fantasies reached high tide in the early '80's, but by 1985's \"The Goonies,\" the run was over.  The genre was exhausted.  Except for the technology, nothing is new.  \n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: I'm going to leave the same review at every Harry Potter film. The Harry Potter film series is seriously the best! I can watch it over and over again and I will never get tired of it. I love this whole magic world and I love how perfectly connected the series are. I was a huge fan when I was a child and I surely still am - 10/10!!\n",
            "Rating: 1, Review: This is the biggest movie farce in history.  First of all, The special effects make the adults go wild, and the little kiddies that dont even read the books, and look at the picture on the front cover, and try to be cool, see this movie because they are to lazy to read. This is the same exact story as the book.  Harry lives with a mean aunt and uncle, he goes to hogwarts, he plays quidditch.\n",

            "Rating: 10, Review: I had read J. K. Rowling's first Harry Potter book before I saw its cinematic adaptation (it happened the other way round in the case of the remaining instalments) and I was very pleased with the movie. I still am. Chris Columbus was criticised for being too slavishly faithful to the book but in my view that was just the right approach. The movie presented Harry Potter's world exactly the way I had envisioned it. The cast was perfect, the tone was perfect, the visuals were perfect. Granted, the book is richer and funnier (Rowling has a very British, wicked sense of humour) but it is ultimately a children's book with a universal message about the value of love, friendship and courage, so, in my opinion, veering towards a darker, more grotesque feel would have been a mistake.\n",
            "Rating: 8, Review: With Professor McGonagall's (Maggie Smith) description of young Harry Potter, I wonder if J.K. Rowling ever realized the world wide phenomenon she would be creating with the series of novels that began with 'The Sorceror's Stone', and the subsequent movie franchise that would make her Britain's wealthiest citizen. Well, it's history now, and for future generations, the saga of Harry Potter will be relived again and again to the wonderment of new fans and followers.\n",
            "Rating: 7, Review: Okay I'm gonna say this honestly, I absolutely love this movie. Take in mind that I've read the novels, I'm a big fan and I watched this movie for the first time when I was 10. This is a good adaptation of a great book, but I will say that the only thing that disappoints me now when I watch it is that I can't help, but imagine what it would have been like if JK's first choice of director had been picked (Terry Gilliam). Terry would have definitely been more creative and he probably would have brought something different to the table. I agree with British film critic Mark Kermode, Columbus does have a rather \"bland and straight-forward\" direction style. Now that may work in some movies, but not in a fantasy film like Harry Potter. I must say though in his defense that second movie was much better than the first one, and it seemed to be an improvement for Chris who was probably a lot more comfortable with his surroundings, and had a better relationship with the actors. Still both films are a bit bland in comparison to the rest of the franchise, most of all if we were to compare the first two, to the third one which was directed by the wonderful Alfonso Cuarón, who's style of direction is considerably different from Columbus'. Apart from the blandness the film is great fun for the whole family, and there's always a distinctive energy when you're watching a new HP flick in theaters with a bunch of enthusiastic fans. People are saying now that Twilight is going to replace HP, but I don't think so. The Twilight fan base is only a third of the HP fan base, and the film series is close to been the biggest franchise of all time, and I think they can actually accomplish that. There's great acting by everyone, most of all by the Golden Trio, Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and the lovely Emma Watson. Also stand out performances by Maggie Smith as the strict but fair Professor McGonagall, and Alan Rickman as the \"greasy git\", also known as Professor Snape. Richard Harris excels as the Headmaster of Hogwarts Academy, Dumbledore. He plays Harry's mentor to a tee. And I have to say I sorely miss him even if Gambon is doing a great job as his replacement. I just wish Richard would have lived far enough to finish the film series, but I guess you can't get everything you wish for.\n",
            "Rating: 8, Review: Harry Potter, on the other hand, is not perfect. It can't compare with other world classics.\n",
            "Rating: 5, Review: I read enough of the first \"Harry Potter\" book to know that Chris Columbus virtually recreated it scene by scene. However, I also read enough to know that what he put on screen was a plodding, overly literal adaptation that doesn't have an ounce of magic or creativity in it.\n",
            "Rating: 3, Review: This to date is the only Harry Potter film I have sat through and watched from start to finish. I have seen bits and pieces of the others, but watching them I just feel the same thing that I did when I watched this one. In a word 'bored'. The only thing that kept me entertained was the scenery and seeing the many British A and B list stars. The most enjoyment I got out of the film is saying \"its the villain from Die Hard! he must be a bad guy!\", \"That's the dude who got messed up by Gene Hackman in Unforgiven!\", \"he was in a couple of Bond films!\", and you get the idea. The film features Harry Potter going to wizard school for the first time. His aunt and uncle keep him living in a closet so going to wizard school or heck math camp would be a nice change of pace for the kid. Well when he goes to school he makes friends quickly with this lass and red headed boy and these three would grow up into some very poorly photogenic to old for the roles adults. Seriously, they looked like they were stoned on the DVD cover of Deathly Hallows and all three just do not look like the type of people you put in movies. Well Harry quickly becomes adept at the sport of wizardry Quiditch which involves flying around on a broom and scoring points. I know, when I hear flying brooms I think witches and witchcraft, but this is wizard school cause that is what the author says! There is also a bit of a mystery to be solved and an ending that will become very familiar with those who enjoy this series. I did not care for this one and I never continued following Harry's adventures, I am not going to fault those who do, this set of films just was not for me and man they are going on to long. Heck, by the time they are all finished they will probably remake them all again two years later.\n",
            "Rating: 1, Review: At first I liked the Harry Potter series, it was imaginative, it was original, it was funny, and it had promise. Then the second one came out, \"oh WOW this is heaven, it can't get better than this\", then the third came out, \"I was wrong about the second, because this is awesome\". Then in between finishing the third and the release of the fourth I read the Lord of the Rings. And shortly after, the movies for both came out. I realized the huge difference, I was psyched out when I heard they were making a Harry Potter movie, but there they go and ruin it. Did you know Spielberg was originally supposed to direct, until Miss Rowling insisted it HAD to be an all British cast, in walks in Chris Columbus, a guy who directed Robin Williams in becoming a woman in \"Mrs. Doubtfire\", and a guy who's obviously willing to give in to any demand thrown at him by the author as long as he makes money. Well Mr. Columbus seemed to direct Ron into acting like a woman as well. You throw in a B list of child actors and a list of acclaimed adult actors who are far past their prime and who only opted to make these films because their grandchildren begged them to, and you have the first Harry Potter movie. There has never been a more horrific performance than that of Rupert Grint, who now dominates the worst performances of all time, kicking Jake Lloyd from The Phantom Menace out of the way. Daniel Radcliffe doesn't really possess much talent either, I highly doubt he has any future after this film, as far as acting goes anyways. As for Emma Watson, who thinks she's the best in the world, and if you think I'm talking about her performance as Hermione, you're dead wrong, have you listened to her in interviews? The room can barely fit the three of them; her, the interviewer, and her ego. Her performance is also astonishingly bad. I forgot to mention the horrible special effects, I have seen better on TV watching \"Power Rangers\". I mentioned the Lord of the Rings earlier to make reference to the obvious ripoffs of Miss Rowling. Firstly there are the dementors, cloaked ghostlike figures whose faces you never see (cough, RINGWRAITHS!). The whomping willow seems to ring a bell (ENTZ). The Giant Spider named Aragog (SHELOB). The trolls also seem to resemble something I've seen before... OH YEAH, the trolls in Lord of the Rings! Hopefully Warner Bros. choice of hiring different directors for the rest of the films will pay off. But this is the perfect example of a book that could have made an Oscar worthy classical movie, but fell short because instead of making it what it was intended to be they chose to skimp on the effects to make more money on little kids who think it's great because they're too young to watch real special effects in Star Wars or LotR. It really makes me sad, because in the months prior to the first movie I was marveling at the promise of it all. Richard Harris, Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman, they got John Williams to do the score, and like that, it was ruined. Although it does seem that my opinion differs from the rest of the world as Miss Rowling is just raking it in and so are the filmmakers, making even more money by skimping on the special effects that will no doubt succeed in dazzling children who aren't yet potty trained. Here's one buck the woman won't get her hands on.\n",
            "Rating: 1, Review: Ouch. This film irritated me so much I was in tortuous pain by the end of it. I only really have one reason for despising this film, but this reason is so monumental in its power that it caused me to spend much of the film writhing around on the carpet in agonising spasms, spasms from which I am only just beginning to recover. The reason ladies and gentlemen, is terrible child acting.\n",
            "Rating: 8, Review: With every major franchise, trilogy, etc. everything must start somewhere, and to most people the first two installments in the Harry Potter franchise always seem to have negative reviews. I don't blame them, some things feel a little out of order and some things are dated but nevertheless Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone makes for a true fun and entertaining film unlike most.\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: When I watched this movie at the first time I wasn't really aware what is it about. I was only ten years old, at the age when everyone believes that magic is real, that his or her own fantasies and most wild dreams can finally come true.\n",
            "As I remember this film was one of the first films arranged for children around 7-12 years old, so it was like present for me.\n",
            "Set in early nineties, this story takes place in London. The plot revolved around Harry Potter, whose parents where murdered by one of the greatest dark wizards of all time Lord Voldemord. Despite the fact that he was with his mother when she died, he survived, the fact that made him famous in wizarding world. He used to live with his cruel relatives, Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia, but now he is about to leave their house to learn magic in Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.\n",
            "Daniel Radcliffe, actor who played titular protagonist, despite the fact that he was only twelve when first of Harry Potter movies released, could perfectly show all emotions little Harry felt all over this story. As movie about magic, it is exciting and breathtaking, with perfect decorations and interesting plot twists. It has bewitching magical effects, that makes you believe in reality of what is happening. A bonus is perfectly matched themes, like well-known \"Hedwig Theme\". The adventures of little boy and his friends will grab you out and never leave you until movie ends.\n",
            "This is one of the best films about magic in many years. Not one generation grown watching this movie. I hardly advice you to watch it and plunge in atmosphere of Witchcraft and Wizardry.\n",
            "Rating: 5, Review: I'm in a rather embarrassing position when it comes to the world of Harry Potter. I'd never heard of the books, much less read any until the films came out. Shows how unaffected I was by the whole Potter phenomenon. JK Rowling's tales of a boy wizard at a magic school is one of the most amazing things to hit the world of children's fiction since Roald Dahl was alive and kicking.\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: I first watched this on VHS way back in the day, I remember thinking eh... it was ok, then a few years later got into the books and came back to watch the movies and BAM that was it.\n",
            "Rating: 5, Review: I'm not sure why, but I never really enjoyed reading or watching Harry Potter and the philosopher's stone. It feels very childish and aimed at a younger audience. Not to mention that the actors look a lot younger than 11. I felt a bit bored watching it and didn't really enjoy it. Nonetheless, it is Harry Potter, so I will give it a 5.\n",
            "Rating: 8, Review: So.....where to begin? It's such a great book adaption movie- Thing whatever you call it! The Harry Potter movies start here when the actors were around 10 or 12! Anyway the movie is amazing BUT. BUT. The effects sort of look dated now seeming we have more impressive CGI than a bunch of years before when we first invented CGI in 1990 or 1989. Anyhow Harry Potter And The Philosopher's Stone is a Blimey Superb movie for its time and I give it a 8/10 for great actors, stunning CGI, Amazing story AND GREAT HARRY POTTER PERSON CALLED DANIEL RADCLIFFE!!!!!! ...l..................Will...............Do..................... .The..Next...........Review.......IS HARRY POTTER AND THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS\n",
            "Rating: 9, Review: While not a reader of the books, I take this series as pure escapism, total fantasy and not a promotion extolling the virtues of witchcraft. In fact, I think it does just the opposite, showing how dangerous it is to flirt with the dark arts, that life is better left to chance, and that while spells and incantations might seem an easy way to get what one desires, those methods aren't generally realistic. The first episode of the long movie series gets every detail letter perfect and \n",
            "Rating: 8, Review: After watching Crimes of Grindewald which was pretty bad I decided to rewatch all Harry Potter movies. Watching this one again felt like watching it for the first time and nostalgia was present of course. You have to admire young Radcliffe,Watson and Grint because they acted like adults. Great start to amazing franchise.\n",
            "Rating: , Review: I must admit right up front that I have never read the J.K. Rowling novel on which `Harry Potter: The Sorcerer's Stone' is based.  As a result, I come to the movie `cold' as it were, being neither a full-fledged aficionado nor an inveterate denigrator of this phenomenally popular book series that, in the past few years, has taken the literary world by storm.  Thus, I will not be able to say to what degree Chris Columbus' handsomely designed film adaptation does or does not do justice to its source.  All I can say is how the film struck someone like myself who comes to the material fresh and without expectations of any kind. Well, the verdict, I must say, is a decidedly mixed one, so please allow me to elaborate.\n",
            "Rating: 1, Review: First off I'll start on the basics that others have mentioned. The acting is bad from the three child-actors. I thought this might be because they were so young but I've seen the fifth film and it still doesn't improve. Their acting is on a \"school play\" level with over-emphasised lines and facial expressions. Daniel Radcliffe was chosen for this film because he looks like the character but by the fifth film he no longer looks like him. The silly glasses make this slightly better but it's a cheap effect. The ginger kid was annoyance personified and I could write an essay on his irritating habits. I detest the way he uses soft swear words like bloody with that fake working class accent. The girl overdid the \"goody goody girl\" role.\n",
            "Rating: 3, Review: I've read the first Harry Potter book and I greatly enjoyed it.  (As an aside I'm also a conservative fundamentalist Christian who does not think that Harry Potter is recruiting tool for Satan).\n",
            "Rating: 1, Review: That's right. I grew up as a snot nosed kid during the hype of Harry Pot head. I mean Harry Potter. The hype was annoying during those days.\n",
            "Rating: 2, Review: There is a classic early 90's \"Far Side\" cartoon of 3 people standing in an otherwise empty room with a banner hanging overhead painted with the letters, 'DLDWWS,' which stands for \"Didn't Like Dances With Wolves Society.\" Gary Larson really captured a phenomenon of what I'd call the 'societal embrace.' People look for things to identify with to make them feel like they're a part of mass culture. Enough people give this product their stamp of approval that it nearly becomes propaganda. No person can escape at least making a decision about that product. People are more likely to decide something's good if someone else tells them it's good, even though they would have felt indifferent otherwise. This cultural phenomenon has happened many times, including this year. In late 2001 and early 2002, there was no escape from Harry Potter. (pronounced 'Paw-TUH' because I've rarely heard it said otherwise. Hogwarts, Middle Earth, Ridley Scott, James Bond, Austin Powers, Shrek-talking like a stuffy brit is definitely cool again.)\n",
            "Rating: , Review: Back when I started reading the Harry Potter books I thought they would just be pulp fiction type, churned out novels with no real substance, but I actually quite enjoyed them, so when the movies came out I was worried.\n",
            "Rating: 1, Review: I have not read any Harry Potter books.  Be that as it may, when the glowing reviews started to come in for this film I decided to take a look at it.  I cannot comment on the translation from book to film or the quality of Rowling's books but the film of the very first novel is quite horrible.  I tried to like it, but I found it excruciating to watch.  It took me no where and, even worse, it really didn't have much of a plot.  The thin shreds of plot were introduced 1 hour and 45 minutes into the film.  The first part of the film was obviously conceived to give a background to the viewer of the Potter world.  Unfortunately there was little to grip me here and I found most of it to be grossly out of place.  What the heck does a game of \"Quidditch\" have to do with the story?  It, and many other things, were just eye candy.  The characters were stale and seemed like rejects from a Roald Dahl story (see James and the Giant Peach).  I'm flabbergasted that such a piece of junk has attracted so many adamant fans.  No wonder kids don't know how to read or write very well anymore.  No wonder Britney Spears and N'Sync are so possible.  The piece of trash that is Harry Potter explains it all - the current generation will cling to anything as long as they don't have to think for themselves.  'Tis a pity.\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: I saw this movie 3 times. It was so good, and I love the book, of how they wrote it and they also did put alot of stuff in the movie from the book and I like it. I really think this movie was very good. But I am still happy, that it is not scary. But I really liked this movie and I really think this movie. I gave it a thumb up, all the way. So feel free to respond and talk to you soon everyone!!!\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: I love this movie, it is excellent. Everything in it is, acting, costumes, production, directing, script, photography, set decoration, etc. Kudos to the cast, crew, and filmmakers. Two Thumbs Way Up! 10 out of 10 golden stars. \n",
            "Rating: 1, Review: This film was to put it simply rubbish. The child actors couldn't act, as can be seen by Harry's supposed surprise on learning he's a wizard. \"I'm a wizard!\" is said with such indifference you'd think he's not surprised at all. I've never read the books and this film did nothing to make me want to read them. The only spell this cast over me was one to get me out of the room as quickly as possible every time I have seen this on after my first viewing of it in the cinema. If you want to see a decent book made film watch Lord of the Rings or possibly the sequel to this which I thought was actually good. 1/10\n",
            "Rating: 1, Review: I have seen both Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings during the past couple of weeks. Both have an unbelieveable amount of hype behind them, and both films are based on extremely popular fantasy book however, that's where the difference ends. Harry Potter is just hype and Lord of the Rings is what delivers. But, that's another review. Harry Potter is an eleven year old boy living in England with his irritating aunt and uncle who really don't care for him. He is wisked away to become a wizard at Hogwarts school of wizards. From there he makes a lot of friends and learns to become a wizard. He plays games on broomsticks, and fights a lot of fake looking monsters. And in the end, he meets the evil wizard who killed his parents. Now, the film isn't that bad, but it's really silly and got quite boring after a while, some of the sequences were ripped off from The Phantom Menace, (The Quidditch match, etc) Anyways, kids love it, I didn't A 3 out of 10, decent special effects, and sets, but, a bland, and unoriginal script that only children who are diehard fans of the book will enjoy. (I have not read any of the books, and this movie makes me want to stay away from them.)Wait for the hype to end and see it on video!\n",
            "Rating: 1, Review: Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, as it is called everywhere else besides the US, and I'd like to know why, is no more than a 5th rate failure at best.  Now I know I'm probably enraging every single person who has read the novel, however this movie is not the novel.  Book and Film are two totally different mediums.  Something that works in a novel, wont decessarily work on the big screen.  Harry Potter is the greatest example of that.\n",
            "Rating: , Review: As a young-adult who missed to watch the Harry Potter series when released, I always felt like missing out on something. Trying to meet those experiences at a later age. I know for a fact a 12 year old me, would probably love this movie and would totally be into the whole series. Moreover this movie is still enjoyable, although I have been exposed by many media exposures of most scenes or even whole plots this was still entwrtaining. As I heard before \"There is no cast better chosen as in Harry Potter.\", I have to agree to that! Although now seen as classic Potter-actors this first part really highlights how much they fit the characters made by Rowling (somehow I only remember reading her first book). I'm looking forward to the rest of the series to enjoy at a later age as my surroundings!\n",
            "Rating: 8, Review: The first of the popular books by J.K. Rowling was one of the most anticipated films at the time, and it became one of the most successful family films in cinema, from director Chris Columbus (Home Alone, Mrs. Doubtfire). Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) has lived with his Uncle Vernon (Richard Griffiths) and Aunt Petunia (Fiona Shaw) and their son since he was a baby. Then one day, after attacks by letters for him, Rubeus Hagrid (BAFTA nominated Robbie Coltrane) takes Harry to be taught at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. He takes money from the Wizard Bank and buys a wand from Mr. Ollivander (John Hurt) on the way, and he also finds out he is famous for surviving an attack by He Who Must Not Be Named, explaining the scar on his forehead. When Harry is on his way to Hogwarts at London Liverpool Station he needs to find Platform 9 and 3 quarters, and asking Mrs. Molly Weasley (Julie Walters) he goes through a wall between platforms 9 and 10. On the train he meets Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint), and briefly Hermoine Granger (Emma Watson). Then at the school, they meet Professor Minerva McGonagall (Dame Maggie Smith), the mean Slytherin bound Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton), before going in front of Professor Albus Dumbledore (Richard Harris) and the other teachers to be put into the appropriate houses by the wizard hat. The film continues to see their lessons with teachers, including Professor Severus Snape (Alan Rickman) teaching potions, Madame Hooch (Zoë Wanamaker) teaching broom flying, and Professor Flitwick (Leprechaun's Warwick Davis, also playing Goblin Bank Teller) teaching levitation. Then is the first and (then) gripping Quidditch game, Gryffindor vs. Slytherin with Harry as the seeker trying to catch the Golden Snitch to win the game, while everyone scores with the Quaffel. But as time goes by, Harry, Ron and Hermoine discover a plan to steal something guarded by the giant two-headed dog (Fluffy), that they later find out is called the Philosopher's Stone (the Americans insist on calling the boring Sorcerer's Stone). Harry and the other two eventually pluck up the courage to get past the dog, and traps, including Devil's Snare plants, flying keys (to the door) and the giant game of Wizard's Chess. Harry eventually faces his great foe, and he suspected the very mysterious Snape, but it was in fact Professor Quirinus Quirrell (Ian Hart), but the real villain is on the back of his head, Harry's parents killer Vodermort, aka He Who (well, you know the rest). Harry survives and kills Voldermort and Quirrel, is reunited with his friends, Gryffindor deservedly wins the house cup, and Harry goes home with great memories. Also starring John Cleese as Nearly Headless Nick and David Bradley as Argus Filch. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Costume Design and Best Music for John Williams, and it was nominated the BAFTAs for the Alexander Korda Award for Best British Film, Best Feature Film (Children's Award), Best Special Visual Effects, Best Costume Design, Best Make Up/Hair, Best Production Design and Best Sound. Harry Potter was number 45 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, but he was also number 35 on The 100 Worst Britons (the only fictional person, why?), the film was number 11 on The Ultimate Film, and it was number 15 on The 100 Greatest Family Films. Very good!\n",
            "Rating: , Review: I've never watched any of the Harry Potter films start to finish until now. I've just never really been interested enough to do so. Having seen the film, nothing has changed. I've seen worse films but I've also seen better and am not looking forward to future films.\n",
            "Rating: 8, Review: What a charming movie! The storytelling and acting were magical. Can't say the same thing regarding the CGI. The films first 2 acts were wonderful. However, I can see people complaining that they relied too much on world building. The third act, while great, was not as wonderful as acts 1 and 2. Also, the chess battle never worked for me. Overall, \"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's/Philosopher's stone is a magical start to a magical franchise.\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: What a wonderful world J.K. Rowling has set up in the Harry Potter series. I love the fact that the magical people inhabit the 'muggle' world and have to be careful that they keep their world hidden from non-magic people. I have never seen a film like this, especially on this scale.\n",

            "Rating: 1, Review: terribly contrived and juvenile.  From the outset, it treats viewers like they were little children - the problem is, that most children won't realize how terrible it is because they haven't the breadth of experience to notice how contrived and unoriginal the plot is.\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: In my opinion Harry Potter is one of the best series ever made for kids as well as adults! The cast was brilliant and the movie itself was filled to the brim with creative little games and gimics. One of the best films I have ever seen! A 10/10, all the way!!!!\n",
            "Rating: , Review: Excessive and nearly completely tedious first installment in the sure-to-be long running series. The famous books come to life on the silver screen with \"Harry Potter and the Sorceror's Stone\". Young Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) is recruited to Hogwart's School to learn the arts of being a wizard. He immediately makes friends in Rupert Grint and Emma Watson, but nothing seems quite right. The titled stone, guarded by a three-headed dog, appears to be the target of one of the faculty members at the academy. It must be shady professor Alan Rickman, right? Chicago critic Richard Roeper called this \"The Wizard of Oz\" of this film-going generation, but really come on. This movie is not in the galaxy of films as the aforementioned production. Early success here gives way to a nearly unending running time and special effects that could tire more than interest. Rickman, along with legitimate performers like Maggie Smith, John Cleese, Warwick Davis, John Hurt and Richard Harris get shoved aside by ugly visual effects and the film's three adolescent leads (behaving like mischievous brats throughout). Director Chris Columbus (a film-maker that somehow continues to work on big budget junk) continues to show shortcomings and I think the scope of the book and the film are just way too much for him and the performers. 2.5 out of 5 stars.\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: When I first heard that there was going to be a film remake of the Philosopher's Stone, I thought \"Oh no, they're going to ruin it.\" Because as so many people have said in the past to me, a film version of a book is butchered. However, I went to see the film with high hopes, and thankfully, I wasn't disappointed.\n",
            "Rating: 9, Review: Philosopher's stone was a great start to the HP movie series. They visualised the essentials of the story, making the magic come to life. The amount of concept visualisation it took to make the movies a reality was incredible. From props to set design, costume design and character portrayal, the series is a must watch, especially if you need something to watch with family and friends.\n",
            "Rating: 6, Review: Having not read the Harry Potter series of books, I'm possibly not the best and most-enlightened person to comment on the film adaptation, but at the same time, I won't be emotionally clouded to adore everything Harry Potter no matter what it's really like, so can provide an objective viewpoint.\n",

            "Rating: 4, Review: I have not read the books. I was under the impression that the books were for children, but after noticing that many adults were reading them I had to ask someone. I was told the books were sort of like Star Wars - highly accessible for adults. Well, the film is definitely sort of like Episode I. It is made for kids, and I do not find it particularly accessible for adults. \n",
            "Rating: 5, Review: As a faithful rendering of the book squeezed into a two-and-a-half hour period, the movie is beautifully done. I don't have a single complaint about any of the actors, who successfully bring to life, with the aid of costume design and special effects, the many colorful characters from the book. My favorite character, the giant Hagrid, is played by Robbie Coltrane, and I say with no exaggeration that he is exactly how I imagined him while reading the book. It's as if they took the image in my mind and transferred it to the screen. While I had my own personal image of Snape (for some reason, I always imagined him as the head villain from another Chris Columbus film, \"Adventures in Babysitting\"), Alan Rickman is perfect in the role. I usually expect to have words of criticism for some performances, but I just don't. The remaining adult actors, including Maggie Smith as Professor McGonagall and Richard Harris as Albus Dumbledore, are as good as they possibly could be, and the kids do an excellent job of holding their own against these veterans. Some have criticized Daniel Radcliffe for appearing too subdued in the title role, but that's exactly how the character is portrayed in the book: modest, unassuming, and laid-back. The kids who play Harry's two best friends are flawless.\n",
            "Rating: 1, Review: The industry chiefs need to get this through their heads:  Chris Columbus is not good at book adaptations.  Look what he did to Asimov's Bicentennial Man.  Now he's gone and done the same to HP.  1 out of 10 here, for what should have been 10.\n",

            "Rating: 8, Review: In the first film, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, Harry thinks he is\"just Harry\". But actually he's a wizard who lives with his hostile uncle, aunt and cousin somewhere just outside London. On one special day he gets a letter, but his mean uncle Vernon Dursley prevents Harry from opening the letter, which results in an invasion of letters to Harry from Hogwarts, school of Witchcraft and Wizardry. The friendly half-giant Hagrid saves Harry on his eleventh birthday and brings him to the place where he can buy all the things he needs. After finding a wand and a pet, he goes to the station - platform 9 3/4 to be precise - and hops on the train to Hogwarts. This is where he meets his future best friends: Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger. At Hogwarts he meets all the rest of the school, including the teachers and headmaster Dumbledore. He learns all new stuff, find friends but also learns about his past and parents. This first year is also the first time he encounters the most evil wizard of all time: Lord Voldemort, or at least a part of him.\n",

My mother and father took me to our local movie theater to see it. Harry Potter book mania was in full swing and the phenomenon with the wonderful film series was about to explode with joy. Re- watching the films in order now I can look back on this film with a certain point of view. The first three H.P. films feel like stand alone stories and for the most part set up about 70% of the saga. Now that's was \"Sorcerer's Stone is\" a wonderful world building movie that keeps getting built upon with each new film.\n",

Overrated hoopla over JK Rowling's internationally popular junior wizard in training in this first outing with Master Potter enrolled in Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry with the thick, gooey Hollywood homogenization via special effects and a time-straining screenplay adaptation by Steve Kloves (the sorcerer's stone' is first mentioned at the 90 min. mark I kid you not!).

            "Rating: 6, Review: Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone (2001): Dir: Chris Columbus / Cast: Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, Rupert Grint, Richard Harris, Robbie Coltrane: Stunning visual achievement and a triumph in production. Every inch of this film sparks something new and exciting. Unfortunately it views witchcraft as exciting as oppose to dangerous. It opens with the death of Harry's parents and the scar embedded on his forehead. Story follows his ventures at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Filled with great imagery such as invisible cloaks, giant ogres, centors, flying brooms, moving staircases, giant chess games, and a three-headed dog named Fluffy. What is truly remarkable is how it tells a story without surrendering to the visuals. Unfortunately Harry uses vengeful magic to aid his concluding victory as oppose to natural resources. Inspiring work by director Chris Columbus who is a champion with box office hits. His previous successes include Mrs. Doubtfire and Home Alone. Daniel Radcliffe is perfectly cast as Harry companioned with Rupert Grint and Emma Watson as friends he meets on a train to Hogwarts. Richard Harris plays the compelling wizard Dumbledore. Robbie Coltrane plays a friendly giant like character whose dog is of an unusual breed. This film sets the stage introducing the school but it is not for young children who need no class in sorcery.

            "Rating: , Review: Having been what seems like the last holdout of this \"harry potter\" phenomenon, and having never read any of the Rowling books or seeing the film. When I was recently over a female friend's apartment, and her friend as well as her wanted to put on Harry Potter after hearing that I've never seen it, I just inwardly grimaced and went with it. I'm a fair person and I'll admit when I'm wrong. I was going into the film expecting to not like it at most and just be nonchalant to it at the least. But I was surprised to find it pretty good. Obviously made for kids, but so was \"Lybrinth\" and \"the Dark Crystal\" and those are both excellent movies. This film while not reaching the heights of the two previously mentioned films is engaging enough and I did enjoy it. By the by, It's the only film, besides \"Clash of the Titans\" of course that I could ever stand Maggie Smith in. And Emma Watson's character Hermione I wasn't too fond of.\n",
            "Rating: 8, Review: J. K. Rowling's \"Harry Potter\" novels have caught the imagination of the public like no other children's literature of recent years, not even Philip Pullman's \"His Dark Materials\". Rowling's stroke of genius was to combine two areas of children's fiction which are normally kept separate, the world of magic and witchcraft and the world of the boarding school. (The \"school story\", dating back at least to \"Tom Brown's Schooldays\" from the early Victorian period, has long been a prolific source of children's literature in Britain, if less so in other countries). \n",

            "Rating: 6, Review: From what I can remember this movie has a lot of the parts in the book in the actual movie. The thing is the way the movie is executed seemed lame and poorly executed. Some scenes were done pretty well but overall it was a boring experience to sit through this whole movie. It isn't a terrible book to movie adaptation, but it just wasn't that good. A lot of movies isn't as good as the novels it is based on or adapted into and this movie is mediocre at best. And if I review this movie without reading the book, I would probably give it a lower score. Since it's this franchise that kept me interested although I am not a fan of Harry Potter novels. On a positive note I liked how almost every character looked the way I imagined them to look. The acting in this movie however is atrocious, it was like watching a live version of of a Saturday morning cartoon show. Except few of them that was alright or could actually somewhat act. Overall it's a mediocre movie that I probably wouldn't watch again unless I want to know what is going on when the sequels come out, but I doubt it since the franchise is now finished.\n",

It spawned a series of films that have absolutely only gotten better. It launched the career of it's three youngsters who seemed to have been absolutely built for these roles. It brought to the screen an epic fantasy adventure with kids in mind but without holding back a single thing like no other film had ever done. Philosopher's Stone is so important because it gives us the background and beginnings of the famous boy wizard. The film introduces us to characters and locations that fans of the book would be shown like never before. This film captured the book probably better than any other book to film transition in history.\n",

            "Rating: 9, Review: As the first of the famous Harry Potter films, this one managed to restrain its special effects sufficiently not to overwhelm the viewers with too many dazzling visuals at the expense of the story and the amusing characters. The result is most entertaining, and Emma Watson was perfectly cast as the character Hermione. The production is full of famous actors, some recognisable, some not. Robbie Coltrane is particularly effective and endearing, with a broad Somerset accent, of all things! Maggie Smith has little to do but wrinkle her nose. But there is little point in discussing a production which has been reviewed to death and talked about until everyone has lost their breath, and there is nothing to add about all that. In America, this film title used the phrase 'sorcerer's stone' because Americans were presumably considered too ill-educated to know what the Philosopher's Stone is. In Britain and Canada, the title used the correct phrase of 'the Philosopher's Stone'. The Philosopher's Stone (correctly shown in the film as being red in colour) is reputed to have existed, but no one is certain. It was the end-product of alchemy, and had the ability to turn all metals into gold if you sprinkled a little of it on, say, lead, for instance. It also could produce a medicine to allow you to live indefinitely in good health, perhaps for centuries. J. K. Rowling sticks some genuine esoterica into her stories sometimes, and in this one she incorporated the fourteenth century alchemist Nicolas Flamel, whose presumed dates are sometimes given as 1330-1418. He really existed, and his tombstone may be seen in the Musee de Cluny in Paris, on the left as you go up a staircase, affixed to a wall. The staff of the Museum either do not know or pretend not to know who Flamel is, and 'if ye seek ye shall not find', as they all look blank. As far as I know, I may be the only person who has fully deciphered the symbology of this strange stone. Flamel faked his own death to avoid arrest and imprisonment by the French king, who wanted to keep him captive and force him to make gold for him. The tombstone was designed by Flamel himself before he disappeared. For a long time it rested in place in the nave of the Paris church of Saint-Jacques la Boucherie, but that church was demolished long ago, with only its high tower remaining. The Tour Saint-Jacques has now had its scaffolding removed, and is looking splendid and clean. It has long been the symbol of modern French esotericism (which the French call esoterisme), and a famous French esoteric periodical even bore its name. The tombstone was salvaged from the demolition and used for many years, turned upside-down, as a chopping-board for herbs, by a herb-seller in his shop. It was recognised in the 19th century and preserved by an antiquary. The old stone house of Flamel, known as 'the oldest house in Paris', still stands and you can go and eat there in a small and expensive restaurant called after Flamel. There are even two little streets in the vicinity of the Tour named Rue Nicolas Flamel and Rue Perenelle, the latter of which is named for his wife and alchemical collaborator. In the film, Flamel is said still to be alive, and the Stone is his, although he does not appear in the story himself. What happened to Flamel, who was Fulcanelli, all of these things are continuing mysteries which are far more interesting than any J. K. Rowling story. Nevertheless, it is good that young people are being given a small dose of these things in palatable form by Rowling, as it might open their minds, if they can stop texting trivia to each other for long enough to allow their minds to be opened, that is.\n",
            "Rating: 6, Review: The first film in the epic \"Harry Potter\" series, directed by kiddie-movie specialist Chris Columbus, feels a bit slight compared to some of the stories that followed it, but there are many delights here for both Potter fans and fantasy movie fans in general. The fun of the movie always feels a bit contrived and forced, which I think is mostly the fault of the director. But on the other hand a wonderful cast was brought together for this film, a cast which formed the core of the solid ensemble that carried through the rest of the film series (so far). By that I mean not so much the 3 primary child actors, who in this film showed no particular flair or talent (though they look and feel right good casting as opposed to good performing, for the most part) but moreso the supporting cast of mostly British actors.\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone was released in close proximity to the great Lord of the Rings, and while this has happened many times before with the general result that one of the two films is widely, although not always correctly, considered inferior to the other (Independence Day and The Arrival, Armageddon and Deep Impact, etc.), this has surprisingly not been the case with these films. Clearly, The Lord of the Rings is a much more mature and bold film, but the first installment in the Harry Potter series is much more than a childish adventure tale. One of the things that really makes it a great film is that the film is so faithful to the book. The writers and director Chris Columbus wisely decided not to take any creative liberties with the material that they had to work with. I am glad to see this, because literary faithfulness is almost always associated with better adapted films, and it's good to know that no one involved with the making of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone felt the need to improve upon a book that has been justifiably described as a `publishing phenomenon.'\n",
            "Rating: 8, Review: Gone With the Wind was another literary phenomenon that produced a film rendering that had to meet equally exacting fan qualifications. It's comparable in the sense that everyone had an attitude about the casting, which in due course resulted wonderfully. The novelists required a loyalty to the manuscript, which was respected. Directors were enlisted who could be relied upon to deferentially work for the material. Immeasurable arithmetic was done while constructing the corporal worlds of the novels. Producers challenged standard constraints about running time to incorporate all the indispensable narrative episodes.\n",
            "Rating: 9, Review: I love this movie. I was too young to watch it when it came out, I was only four, but when I was old enough to watch it, I just loved it so much. It's so good. The storyline, acting, effects and music are all great. This Harry Potter film is probably my third favorite behind, Goblet Of Fire and Deathly Hallows: Part Two. Which isn't bad, third favorite out of eight movies. If you ever have a Harry Potter-thon, which I do, strap yourself in, because your in for almost twenty hours of amazement.\n",
            "Rating: 8, Review: Yet face, if a book sales well, it is bound to made into a film, regardless of quality, or even if it is filmable. This is true for books like Twilight, the Golden Compass (or Northern Lights what it's really called) and Dan Brown's thrillers. J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter series became one of the most popular series of books of all time, appealing to children and adults. There were written in a assessable style, with a clear and strong narrative, but with a good deal of backstory. A film adaption became enviable.\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: I really like this movie! Even though most of the events in this movie could never happen in the real world, it is awesome. I think that this really set a really good example for all of the other Harry Potter movies. Ever since I saw this movie I have loved the Harry Potter series, the movies and the books! I saw this almost right after it came out on video and I am really happy I did. I think that they chose the right people to play the people in the movie. The director made it a lot like the book, and I really liked that about it! I definitely think that if you haven't seen this movie, you should see it as soon as possible!\n",
            "Rating: , Review: Imaginative, enchanting tale from the novel by J.K. Rowling about a beleaguered young boy who lives with his spoiled cousin and supercilious aunt and uncle. It's not until his eleventh birthday that he learns he's a wizard of unlimited potential, and is recruited to enroll at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry where his late parents have a legacy. The teaching staff prepares him for big things, but he immediately learns that being a wizard is a much more than just fun and games. Engaging story creates a vivid world of magic, mysticism, and trickery, with effective performances from its predominantly young cast, but the script and story can't hold up to the impact of all the razzle-dazzle, and it goes on too long. There's plenty to take in, and lots of fun to be had, but the film is slow going at first, then fast-paced and exciting, then eventually slows down again as it nears its conclusion. **½\n",

            "Rating: 7, Review: Undoubtedly targeted at a very young audience, there's a certain degree of magic dancing around this picture that makes it easily-accessible to adults as well. Although my own childhood was long gone by the time this hit theaters, watching it today was like leaping back through time to an age filled with innocence and wonder. That effect does occasionally get lathered on a bit thick, but a speedy pace and densely populated realm are usually enough to compensate for such moments. JK Rowling's rich, sprawling, imaginative world is downright hypnotizing on the screen, loaded with treats and treasures, and it's tough to look away for even an instant. Although the CGI work is distractingly bad in a few instances (it very nearly ruins the Quidditch match), the child actors are average at best and there isn't much adversity to our heroes' hunt for the MacGuffin Stone, it's still a cheery, entertaining introduction to a universe that's positively buzzing with potential.\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: ''Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\" is a red-blooded adventure movie, dripping with atmosphere, filled with the gruesome and the sublime, and surprisingly faithful to the novel. A lot of things could have gone wrong, and none of them have: Chris Columbus' movie is an enchanting classic that does full justice to a story that was a daunting challenge. The novel by J. K. Rowling was muscular and vivid, and the danger was that the movie would make things too cute and cuddly. It doesn't. Like an \"Indiana Jones\" for younger viewers, it tells a rip-roaring tale of supernatural adventure, where colorful and eccentric characters alternate with scary stuff like a three-headed dog, a pit of tendrils known as the Devil's Snare and a two-faced immortal who drinks unicorn blood. Scary, yes, but not too scary--just scary enough. Three high-spirited, clear-eyed kids populate the center of the movie. Daniel Radcliffe plays Harry Potter, he with the round glasses, and like all of the young characters he looks much as I imagined him, but a little older. He once played David Copperfield on the BBC, and whether Harry will be the hero of his own life in this story is much in doubt at the beginning. During \"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,\" I was pretty sure I was watching a classic, one that will be around for a long time, and make many generations of fans. It takes the time to be good. It doesn't hammer the audience with easy thrills, but cares to tell a story, and to create its characters carefully. Like \"The Wizard of Oz,\" \"Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory,\" \"Star Wars\" and \"E. T.,\" it isn't just a movie but a world with its own magical rules. And some excellent Quidditch players. Watch Alan Rickman drawing out his words until they seem ready to snap, yet somehow staying in character. Maggie Smith, still in the prime of Miss Jean Brodie, is Prof. Minerva McGonagall, who assigns newcomers like Harry to one of the school's four houses. Richard Harris is headmaster Dumbledore, his beard so long that in an Edward Lear poem, birds would nest in it.\n",

The movie, which tells how a seemingly normal boy, Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe), discovers he is actually a wizard and starts attending a school named Hogwarts, encountering many dangers throughout his first year, isn't boring for a second during its 146 minutes, but the pace is occasionally slowed down because, like in other \"part 1 of 3\" movies (actually, they're supposed to be 7), the director spends a lot of time introducing and explaining things, so he won't have to do it in the sequel(s). In this case, Chris Columbus, best known for Home Alone includes as much as possible also to make sure the target audience (kids) will enjoy it, adult viewers being more used to differences between book and film (and thus perhaps likely to find the running time a bit excessive). \n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: I just finished watching all the Harry Potter films back to back to back to back. What a crazy trip. Before starting this review, here is my ranking, from best to worst:\n",
            "Rating: 6, Review: It is fascinating to see what stories and universes land so well with audiences. Harry Potter became one of those lucky stories that captured the hearts and imagination of millions. We see what a creative mind J. K Rowling has in this first film in the series. Despite introducing an intricate and brand new universe, The Philosopher's Stone does a good job in setting up this magical word of Wizards and spells and introduces us to some key characters that many have grown to love. The plot is simple enough and easy to follow and there is enough action to keep you engaged.\n",
            "Rating: 7, Review: 1st watched 11/20/2001 - 7 out of 10(Dir-Chris Columbus): Inventive fantasy film that appeals to young school-age kids in many different ways.  As I watched this movie in the theatre, surrounded by middle school kids, I understood  why they are captivated by this character, Harry Potter.  Not having read any of the books, but only having brief information fed to me by  my 9-year old I was unprepared for what this movie was really about.  I believe this character appeals to kids because #1 - he's from a broken home (like many young kids today), #2 - he's fighting against the evils of the world everyday(like many kids are at this age - trying to figure out what's right and wrong), #3 - it's fun (there was a tremendous game played at Hogwart's where the characters are flying on broomsticks where the pace is very fast like many video games that kids play today), #4 - the class mentality displayed at Hogwart's(similar to school rivalry's just blossoming with kids these days), and finally #5 - Harry wins and wins by playing by the rules(most of the time).  This is even fun  to watch for old-timers like myself (even though I had to get tips from my 9-year old every once in a while about what was happening on-screen, which she gave me unsolicited every couple minutes).  All in all this movie is basically a good time had for all.  Not taken seriously it is very appealing to people of all ages.\n",
            "Rating: 3, Review: Yeah yeah, I get it. Adaptations will almost always lose material, and perhaps this gives the movie an unfair advantage.\n",
            "Rating: 9, Review: Nostalgia is strong with this one. I would give it a ten if not for the slight unconvincing nature of some of the lines. But this film is brilliant, a spectacular start to one brilliant saga.\n",
            "Rating: 5, Review: While me, not growing up being a fan of Harry Potter, I do not find these movie anything special or so good. It was pretty boring some of the time, and was too long. It was still a decent movie though, a fine story. A good kids movie to watch. This is an okay movie 6/10.\n",
            "Rating: 8, Review: It all started in 1990 when J.K.Rowling had the idea about a boy with glasses and black hair, it popped into his head during a train ride from Manchester to London. She has since gone on to work on her first novel, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, and on a plan that included the plots of each of the seven books she planned to release. In the years that followed Rowling had her daughter, divorced her first husband and moved to Portugal, always continuing to write the book. Finally, in 1996, the book was ready, and after eight publishers rejected the manuscript, Bloomsbury agreed to publish it the following year. After its publication, the Harry Potter series gained great popularity and commercial success worldwide and gave rise to films, video games, among others.\n",
            "The great merit of J.K. Rowling that led the series to be so popular with young people is the construction of an intensely pleasant hero and puts his adventures on paper by mixing great dark adventures with light drama and pleasant comedy. It is this same essence and tone that director Chris Columbus employs in this first adventure of the wizard boy, and he does it very well. Usually fans of some work adapted to the cinemas always end up complaining about omitted facts. But this is not the case. Steve Kloves' script is incredibly faithful to Rowling's book. All the remarkable passages for the readers are present and finally manage to cease the curiosity of how everything would be.\n",
            "Steve Kloves' script is the result of meticulous work and should have been nominated for several awards as the best script adapted to that year's Oscar. It keeps all the main passages in the book and many of the characters' speeches come straight from the pages of the book to the mouths of their interpreters.\n",
            "Most of the changes mentioned are natural in adaptations from one medium to another, but what gives the clear feeling that the film is just a clipping of the book's events to the screens giving the feeling of being an episodic film is the plot involving Nicolau Flamel , of essential importance to the drama, and which is mentioned only in the final part of the film, somewhat out of obligation so that all passages of the climax were justified. On the other hand, it should be noted that this first film is about introducing the complex universe of the series to the public. For this reason, Columbus loses the necessary time to introduce the protagonist to the audience (his past history, who he is, how he lives) and the personality characteristics of dozens of other characters, in addition to having to mention several terms and an infinity of scenarios from the wizarding world that the audience gets to know along with Harry throughout the scenes. It is a film that pleases by its ability to be faithful to the book and to consolidate the fundamental bases for films released in the future. For this reason, we have to see Harry still at the Dursleys' house to get to know them better and to know what life was like for the young wizard with his uncles and to give us a sense of the powers that were then unknown to Harry, such as his ability to communicate with snakes. Only afterwards are we introduced to the gigantic and expansive settings at Hogwarts, and then meet the teachers and the various classes they teach. Then we watch Harry and his friends develop over a whole year at school until he can face his first big challenge at the end of the school year (even several of the final challenges use the knowledge they learn in class).\n",
            "The unknown cast of children proved to be the right choice and that was fundamental, since the expectation of success of the film and the permission for the development of the following films was enormous. If a casting choice was wrong, we would have to live with it until the end of the saga. Emma Watson is the perfect Hermione Granger, the little witch daughter of parents who are not wizards and who is extremely studious and smart, and certainly the most intelligent for her age. Who knew that girl would be in the future one of the best actresses and one of the most beautiful of her generation. Rupert Grint also proved to be the best choice to be Ron Weasley. The young actor with natural red hair is one of those who best embodies the character and his clumsy, comical and friendly way. His facial expressions are also priceless. Daniel Radcliffe is the weakest in performance of the main trio, precisely the great protagonist. But even so, his work is very satisfying and only gets better throughout the series. The chemistry of this trio on the scene made them a reference and the success of the features made them three of the richest young people in the world. We also have other highlights like Harry Melling as Duda Dursley, Tom Felton as Draco Malfoy, Matthew Lewis as the clumsy and priceless Neville Longbottom.\n",
            "Rating: 8, Review: There's no need for a synopsis as I think most people know about Harry Potter now but I should point out I haven't read the books. Philosopers Stone is an origin story of sorts and crucial to the Harry Potter franchise as it provides the entire backstory for further movies. The actual plot in this particular movie I found a bit tame but the acting was great and the characters were just as fun as I remembered. The movie is filled with wonderful creatures and the world itself is honestly captivating. The CGI at the time was probably pretty impressive but on my recent viewing, it's really noticable how fake certain things look with the troll in particular aging the worst.\n",
            "Rating: 5, Review: I saw \"Potter\" in an open frame of mind.  I have not read the books, and know next to nothing about the whole Potter phenomenon.  I'm also not particularly into the occult, though that can be interesting, like anything else.\n",
            "Rating: 8, Review: With astonishing production values, terrific scripts and endlessly fascinating serial dramas, my contribution to the phenomenon of the HARRY POTTER films will just be a speck of glitter on the ten ton ball of chrome these films represent in movie history. Now that I have a box set of blu-ray DVDs, I am relishing them title by title as we watch them over and over again at home with and without kids on the lounge too. There are 1001 delights and moments to admire, and endless jaw-dropping visuals and imaginative tricks. Over and over again. However, it is the music scores that I am increasingly loving. Lush lavish orchestrations and endlessly inventive use of individual instruments, and soaring emotional oceans of music. Most acting chops are right, the casting deserves an Oscar of its own, every film, and the delight in seeing, film by film, each young actor journey through their teens to genuine human wonder. The almost seamless transfer of Dumbledore from Richard Harris to MIchel Gambon is not even noticed by the keenest of eyes. I especially liked the hideous Dobby being realized in ghastly character style Arthur Askey. The HP series is GONE WITH THE WIND for the 21st century in landmark film status. Everything works. I recently also saw Radcliffe in THE WOMAN IN BLACK which I thought also quite magnificent.\n",
            "Rating: 2, Review: Word for word, it followed the book.  Some people may see this as a good thing, but the best film adaptations of books are the ones that take the FEELINGS and THEMES from the book and transform them from the written format to the screen.  This movie, however, was like listening to a cassette of the book with silly little special effects and poor animations carrying out the actions.\n",

            "Rating: 8, Review: An orphan is amazed to discover the existence of a secret world of magic when he is whisked away to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft & Wizardry.

            "Rating: 6, Review: Rewatching \"The Sorcerers Stone\" after several years of watching the later more polished entries sort of feels like comparing the 1988 BBC edition of \"The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe\" to the most recent 2005 version. It feels a little dated, a little slow and clunky, but it still has a little nostalgic charm for those who grew up watching them, and for that reason alone I can't give this film anything less than three stars.\n",

            "Rating: 7, Review: And I liked it to(and I'm no child). Harry Potter is such a sweet movie and watching it as an adult, I got that feeling like I have when I've riden \"it's a small world\" at disneyworld. What a lovely piece of escape from the world!\n",
            "Rating: , Review: What a lifeless film.  It's not exactly that Chris Columbus is too faithful to the book - although he fails to make changes that ought to have been made, like removing (or better still, drastically altering) that end-of-term dinner scene at the end, with its vulgar celebration of cheap success -; rather, he transfers material from page to screen with no clear idea of why he's doing so.  The entire film comes across as a cut-and-paste job.\n",
            "Rating: , Review: First let me set the scene. I went to see this film with my near seven-year-old. I hadn't read the book first, though subsequently I have, if only to confirm my thoughts.\n",
            "Rating: , Review: Reminded me rather strongly of both 'Bedknobs and Broomsticks' and 'Oz', apparently does justice to the popular series of books. Now I have not read them-but the material certainly is familiar looking enough. I found this to be, at least as a film:\n",
            "Rating: 7, Review: I was entertained by the first film but I think I enjoyed this one even better. I'm not sure why, maybe because I'm already familiar with the characters so now I could just sit back and instead of trying to figure out who is who I can just enjoy the story. My favorite scene is the spiders! Terrific special effects. what a visual delight, or nightmare! And I was also feeling some sadness as I watched Richard Harris. It's not going to be easy filling his shoes with another actor. I also thought that if they are going to make two more films they had better hurry. These young actors are growing by the minute and it will look pretty ridiculous if Harry Potter needs a shave. Entertaining all the way, This film is fun for adults as well as kids. Chris Columbus has come a long way since those silly \"Home Alone\" movies.\n",
            "Rating: 7, Review: This is a fun, though flawed movie. I'm not a big fan of this franchise, but this is a pretty good movie. \n",
            "Rating: 5, Review: When I bought it on DVD I thought this may be also for adults. I´m now 33 years old and i have to admit that this film is no (more) adapted for me and I would recommend it only for children. Okay the special effects were good but the story was too long and some times too boring. Perhaps the book is more interesting to read because you can imagine in an other dimension. I think the film is too overrated and I give only 5/10.\n",
            "Rating: 7, Review: Well, this first installment brings us to the get go of Potter's life. I thought they would make a too big introduction until we get to the action, but fortunately the writers knew how to make a reasonable time for introduction-- and were able to not make it a boring moment of the film. Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert show in the very first version of the franchise how talented they are, and I'm pretty sure production team already knew they would never disappoint-- and in fact, they never did. \"Sorcerer's Stone\" the whole time tries to make you believe Snape is the bad guy, giving clues he's the one trying to steal the stone-- when in fact, it's another random professor. Special effects are decent for such year it's been released, but for the high budget they had I thought it could be a little more realistic at times. Rest of the cast is good and I don't have one name to flame all around. From now on I'll be seeing the next episodes, and I hope it continues this good!\n",
            "Rating: 1, Review: Maybe the first problem with this kind of movies is their subject; MAGIC. We cannot argue about any aspects of it, because it's magic; anything is possible, we must shut our mouths and sit like a good kid and watch it without any digestion. And that's where the problem grows. We see lots of possible things without any background or history and yet we see some normal things that they cannot do, for example they have this cloak to hide but this could be unnecessary. Why couldn't they just hide themselves with that sticks? Oh, they're not able to do that!!!\n",
            "Rating: 6, Review: The first part of the movie is very good with an excellent re-creation of the atmosphere imagined by J. K Rowling in the book on which it was inspired. All visual special effects are very imaginative and of very good quality. The characters are well designed and very convincing. The human nature (bad or good) of these wizards is extremely well shaped and their performances extremely charming. Well this is true for the first part of the movie which shows, so to speak, the presentation of Hogwarth, the wizard school and its masters and students with a special prominence of the main character of Harry Potter (a well chosen charming child actor) and his two companions Hermione and Ron. However the second part in which the main plot of the searching for the sorcerer's stone develops itself, is much less brilliant in terms of imagination and special effects, becoming sometimes a bit dull and commonplace.\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: Harry Potter is something that I grew up with, movies, games and the novels but I've only read the first two. These movies for me are masterpieces of its genre, it was just great in every aspect. Some things like the special effects, visuals and sets were groundbreaking back in 2001 and it still holds up today except that I can sadly tell that it's CGI at times but I didn't mind it at all. It still has the same heart, the characters are still great, intriguing, funny and well cast. I almost remembered every single scene except for a couple minor ones, I have watched these movies so many times and I still find them enjoyable, even as an adult. Today I noticed that the movie got nominated to 3 Oscars and they were right to get nominations, the music and soundtrack by John Williams should have won as it is something unique and perfect, one of my all time favorite movie soundtracks as it just flows so well with the movie.\n",
            "Rating: 7, Review: Now the reason I make that statement is because you have to be a fan of Harry Potter to have enjoy this movie or you have to be a fan of wizard movies to better enjoy.\n",
            "Rating: 8, Review: Harry Potter is an average bespectacled 11 year old boy who has lived with the Dursley family ever since his parents died in a car crash. For some reason the family has always mistreated him. On his 11th birthday a giant man named Rubeus Hagrid hands him a letter telling him that he has been accepted as a student at the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Harry learns that his parents were wizards and were killed by an evil wizard Voldemort, a truth that was hidden from him all these years. He embarks for his new life as a student, gathering two good friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger along the way. They soon learn that something very valuable is hidden somewhere inside the school and Voldemort is very anxious to lay his hands on it.\n",
            "Rating: 8, Review: Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone is an amazing start to the Harry Potter series by setting the stage for how the books will be adapted to the big screen. It is a bit outdated and does has its flaws in quality but as to be expected seeing as it's the first of the series and needed to establish the series before the movies could advance. The movie itself does stay true to the book and has a very similar whimsical and nostalgic feel throughout. All of the main characters are portrayed well and accurately and you just feel entrenched in the magic throughout. Highly recommend this movie and the entire series.\n",
            "Rating: 8, Review: Harry Potter is here to stay! Almost down to the last couple films, the Harry Potter series may end up being the most successful franchise in film history...not Star Wars, not LOTR, not Indiana Jones, not Batman, not even James Bond...but Harry Potter! And this film, HARRY POTTER AND THE SORCERER'S STONE (2001), is the one that started it all! Really a super-cute kid's fantasy film while the future ones went darker and deeper, I still find this first one very enjoyable and watchable.\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: Except for the end part with \"He Who Must Not Be Named\" (which bares a strange similarity to the Hebrew God \"He Who has no name?\") almost as enjoyable as the \"Wizard of Oz\" 1939 classic for both its content and whimsy. I don't know why this is not considered the best of the series? We are introduced to a world that is entirely invisible to the average \"Muggle\"? Such ingenuity and imagination: The street of shops, the bank, Hogwarts , the magical train, nasty bankers, giant trolls, dragons, multi-headed guard dogs, wizards both good, evil, and questionable in nature... Only the introduction of the evil Voldemort tarnishes the major of the whole experience. Without viewing this first film, it is impossible to appreciate and enjoy the entire series which has several meaner, darker (and less pleasant) \"chapters\".\n",

            "Rating: 5, Review: Even compared to the majority of fantasy films, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone takes the magical powers and fantastical creatures way too far. It's just like the Harry Potter book series written by J. K. Rowling, except Chris Columbus has brought the words and magic to the screen.\n",
            "Rating: 8, Review: This movie has some of the best child acting and child performances that I've ever seen! I've been a fan of this movie ever since 3rd grade and it's one of the best first installments that have ever been made (even though some of the special effects don't hold up anymore and it's looked faker over the years, however it still has awesome costumes and make up). The acting from the adults were impressive as well and I really got invested in the Harry Potter universe with this first film! Imo, it's even better than the Fellowship of the Ring! Plus, the music composed by John Williams is magical by itself! While many aren't fans of J. K. Rowling anymore, she will always deserve credit for this genius and magnificent creation!\n",
            "Rating: , Review: I truly missed this one when it came out in theatres,but now that it is out on videocassette and DVD,I finally got the chance to see last night for the very first time. However,since this was based on the popular best-selling children's books by J.K. Rowling this was a fantasy feature that has come to life. This lavish film version ends up working on both levels: as a stand-alone motion picture and as a worthy adaption of a novel that,while hardly a literary landmark,is nevertheless brilliantly funny,inventive and full of imaginary spunk. Director Chris Columbus has a deserved reputation for making cloying films(Home Alone,Mrs. Doubtfire and Bicentennial Man),but here he has deftly allowed the movie to carefully walked the precious line between being too syrupy for adults and too grave for children(there are some very scary scenes here that may be too intense for those under the age of 12 since the film carries a stern \"PG\" rating). In other words,this movie is way,way,COOL! Even though it was just a flick for the kiddies,it was spectacle beyond belief. Part Wizard of Oz,the flying sequence of both Steven Spielburg's E.T.,and part Return Of The Jedi,this was a must see. A grand technical achievement.\n",
            "Rating: 7, Review: The sequel as well as the book has turned out excellent. At last that in the 2nd movie more attention was paid to the main antagonist. The truth here Tom Redll looks too romaticized, than in the latest books and movies of the saga. The 2nd part very much of a campaign on the first, it is the last \"children's\" part. The only thing that it became much better - dynamics of successions of events has considerably accelerated. The first part nevertheless was too linear and short (I mean only the movie), and the introduction tightened.\n",
            "Rating: 7, Review: This movie beginning of one of the most known and cult film franchizes. And though the first movie about Harry Potter looks too children's and simple, he has begun a series. The plot of the movie as well as book is simple, but as it was fine to watch it for the first time.\n",
            "Rating: , Review: Now pay attention students (You thought I was going to say \"007\" then, didn't you?), lets get this straight...HARRY POTTER AND THE SORCERER'S STONE (PHILOSOPHER'S STONE in just about every country but the US) is NOT a great movie. The most expensive to date maybe, certainly hyped and marketed into the stratosphere, but despite many redeeming features which I will get to later, it remains curiously ordinary!\n",
            "Rating: 8, Review: Now I'm not the sort of hateful guy that looks at such a movie and cries foul.

            "Rating: 10, Review: I'm a big fan of Harry Potter; the books AND the movies. I can easily say that the first movie of the series is my favourite among all 8 HP movies, and it's also one of the most successful adaptations among films based on books. It must have been a huge challenge to reflect J.K. Rowling's amazing world to the big screen, and equally challenging to do so with three main characters who happen to be only kids at the very start of their acting career. However, everything's done so professionally that the magic in the book is transferred into a movie which is interesting for almost any age group in my opinion. The glory of the unique adventure of Harry Potter is nicely put in the screenplay and every little detail from costumes to locations are blended into a movie which is only the beginning of a legendary saga.\n",
            "Rating: 8, Review: Probably the best start Harry Potter could have ever had. This film is incredible. It has everything you could have imagine. Action, sadness and even revenge. The way the film is set out is amazing. The style on Hogwarts and the CGI brings the book to life. All the characters are acted out perfectly and are just like they should be. I certify this film: GOOD.\n",

            "Rating: 10, Review: I am amazed by this movie even after rewatching it so many years after it's release. Although it is better for kids and was better at time it was released and at times when pc game and books was released, and is best for those who previously read books or played games, it is not a disappointment for adults or people who hear for it for the first time, even if late. There is so much stuff why this is enjoyable. Magic, adventure, emotions, relationships, comparison and analogous to real world, and associative with religion. For example it reminded me of religious history and explanations of various invisible worlds that our eye can't see, and which is presented in this movie better than in any religious book probably. Exciting realistic and graphics are the most realistic and best. Even newest movies in 2020 are not comparable by so ralistic graphics to this one.\n",
            "Rating: 7, Review: Harry Potter and the sorcerer's stone is the worst of the six films. It's not that it's a bad film, which it's not. I don't want to be mean here, but the three main characters, Harry,Ron, and Hermione, are annoying. I know it was there debut, but i'm sorry. I'm not even sure if it was there fault. But the reason why I think it's the worst is because the three main actors(Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson) are annoying. It's not that they're bad actors. The thing is that Why would these three kids care about all of this stuff. Besides Harry Potter himself, why would the characters care if Snape was a villain or about the Sorcerer's stone or anything? They're supposed to be eleven. That's not all that I have a problem with. Chris Columbus doesn't have the mind that Alfonso Cuaron, Mike Newell and David Yates have. He's used to all of the cutsy stuff. I'm making The Sorcerer's stone seem like a bad film, which it's not. It is still a fun, cute movie to watch. At least the first two films aren't as good as any of the Lord of the Rings films. I mean seem like i'm not recommending it, but I am recommending it. Despite some of the flaws, Harry Potter and the sorcerer's Stone is on par with the book. it's the weakest of the films, but it's still a lot of fun.\n",
            "Rating: , Review: This was a pleasure to watch. Eager fresh faces, a galaxy of veteran British actors, sparkling photography, a sympathetic main character, a truly brilliant set piece (the Quiddich match), plenty of action, a pleasing combination of the real and the fantastic in set design and plenty of appropriate special effects. It was amusing to see the absurdly pompous ground floor of Australia House in London as the banking chamber of Gringott's Bank. I'm afraid to say the people behind the counter in real life are just as unsympathetic as the goblins of Gringott's. It must be the architecture.\n",

Chris Columbous has made his best film since the oringial Home Alone, a film that everyone can enjoy. The film is full of great special effects, acting and warmth, The Quigwich match was really. From now on every Harry Potter film will recieve my money in the theater.\n",

            "Rating: 10, Review: I remember when this first came out and I was totally amazed. The piles money put into this project were staggering; the excellent directing was flawless and the skills of such a young cast were unbelievably so professional. Before I continue, I did not read the books nor do I have any desire to. I am not a Potter-head. I have heard the movies were 'just OK' compared to the books. OK – I can deal with that, but I had a great time. If I enjoyed what I saw in the theater why would I destroy something I thoroughly destroyed? The first time I saw, 'The Sorcerer's Stone' I really enjoyed it. I did not write anything about it until I sat down and watched again the other day. After seeing it the second time I felt compelled to give this movie some kind of kudos. This is a very stunning and charming journey through a fantasy world which captured the entire world by storm. In my opinion this was the best of all the other installments. Why? I guess it's because everything was so new and the kidswell they were such cute little rascals. They were just itty-bitty things and waving around their magic sticks. How cool it that? I am not saying the early sequels were not bad they just didn't measure up to the freshness of the original. I will also have to say that the later oneswell the sell-by date had expired and the storyline was beginning to stink of political correctness. It is too bad the author's social views spilled into a perfectly good adventure series. But that is the choice of the stories' creator. I guess fame and money tends to unveil hubris and opinions. Maybe I am too hard on the Potter Saga, so I will give the entire series a fresh look and maybe I will adjust my thinking accordingly. As always, I go to a movie for entertainmentnot to be preached to.\n",

            "Rating: 7, Review: Separated by 20 years from first seeing this in the cinema, and by more years from over-familiarity with the book, this is much more fun than I remember it being at the time. It has all the joy, magic and wonder it needs, and the plot no longer feels like it's on rails in a slavish fidelity to the book. It doesn't need to be this long, but it works well ... not least due to the near-faultless casting which, as well as ensuring the film meets its mark sets the whole series up for success.\n",

            "Rating: 7, Review: My review of this film may be a little blinded by the fact that i hate kids films but that apart i can see why kids would like this film. The story is very good as are the special affects and there is a very good cast of actors. The shame is that the lead star is the poorest of all the actors including all the other child actors. It's ok to have the Harry Potter look but it does help have the acting abilty too and i'm afraid Daniel Radcliffe does not have it. Robbie Coltrane and Richard Harris are superb . I have not seen read the book (im one of the few!)so i have an unbiased point regarding the comparison but i can see how the book would have some appeal if it is anything like the film. All in all not bad but not my cup of tea. 7 out of 10.\n",

            "Rating: 9, Review: \"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\" is a wonderful movie. This comes from a Harry Potter illiterate. The story and movie are very reminiscent of the Star Wars mythology. Orphan Harry has special gifts-- an undeveloped and natural power. He like Luke Skywalker is the chosen One. So he must be trained. In Harry's case this takes place at the Hogwart School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Harry is to become a great wizard, like Luke becomes a powerful Jedi. Along the way, we learn that there is a very powerful and seductive \"dark side\" to Magic. Ultimately the path is a choice or perhaps a sacrifice. Harry feels alone and incomplete-- he yearns for his dead parents. The whole scene with Harry sitting in front of the Mirror of Erised and speaking with Richard Harris as Dumbledore (Hogswart Headmaster) made it for me. Dumbledore says that men have gone mad looking into the Mirror living their dreams, \"...forgetting to live.\" Great stuff. Looks like the other books may be darker as Harry seeks out the man responsible for murdering his parents. Also the message that true magic does not come from books, rather from friendship, bravery, and ultimately love is touching. The movie is a magical journey of a hero, Harry. \n",

            "Rating: 4, Review: While the series improves as it progress, I found the first two instalments of the Harry Potter franchise quite unenjoyable. Rowling relies heavily on plot band-aids to cover up her mediocre writing and I really cannot think of a more overrated author. I don't even know where to begin regarding the logistical errors of Rowling's work in this particular story. The nonsensical Quidditch scoring system, the abusive Dursleys, Harry's entirely inherited magical abilities, the ridiculous house points scoring system (the ending is just a joke, if I was in Slytherin I would have rioted). These are all bad enough, but it's the overall lack of a cohesive plot that really makes this story so weak. There is no real reason why anything happens, it's merely just a string of random events designed to make the main characters look heroic while the adults gush over them from afar.\n",

            "Rating: 8, Review: This is a great adaptation of the first Harry Potter novel, with a properly paced story that takes you along for a magic joy ride. I'm especially pleased with the score by John Williams, who again creates a memorable main theme (the last memorable one being 1993's Jurassic Park) and keeps the story moving along. The kids that play the main characters are properly cast, along with the adults (especially Alan Rickman as Severus Snape and especially Richard Harris as Albus Dumbledore - he is sorely missed after Chamber of Secrets, RIP). Unlike the successive films, this has the simplest of stories and is therefore the easiest to follow. And because it is the first film, we, along with Harry Potter as our guide, are happily discovering the new world of magic and witchcraft. A solid of 8 out 10!\n",

Since I am doing a marathon of these once again I wanted to review this time around. This movie never feels dull. It's action packed, funny, and heartfelt. There are so many qualities that draw me to the Harry Potter movies. Daniel, Rupert, and Emma are so fun and adorable while acting in this movie. They have the balance of being adventurous but cautious and have a great portrayal of friendship. The magic is enticing while watching. I always can't wait to finish and watch them every time.\n",

I have read the book once, and the film matches up with the book, which is odd because usually the movies are always different from the book. Daniel Radcliffe did an okay performance as Harry Potter, as well as Rupert Grint as Ron Weasley and Emma Watson as Hermione Granger. The movie is a great family movie that is highly entertaining. The movie is a well adaption to the book, and is filled with mind blowing special effects and action. I give Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone a 10 out of 10. :)\n",

The introduction to the characters, the immersion into the fictional world, the first time you laugh, cry, care, and fear for someone's safety can never be repeated. No matter how many Harry Potter movies they crank out, or if they ever remake them in the future, none will come close to the wonderful first film, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone.\n",

            "Rating: 6, Review: 'Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone' is the introduction film to the Harry Potter series based on the best-selling book. The film is as sweet and as engaging as the book, introducing the underdog Harry, who was forced to live in the closet under the stairs by his mean aunt and uncle and who does not have a happy, loving family. He learns that he is actually from a magical family, and this takes him to a magical school called Hogwarts where he meets two good friends Hermione and Ron and unfortunately makes some enemies with a couple bullies. The three friends find themselves solving mysteries and becoming heroes. It's quite well-written with a twist at the end. Overall, it is a good introduction to the characters and contains some innocent fun and some action that is truly magical.\n",

Words can't describe this. It's about 2hours and 15minutes bore, headache, and everything else bad. It's better to count the stars than to watch this piece of sh*t. What was this movie all about? Hmmmm. Don't know. It was about nothing. It was about stupidness that Hollywood produces and people still watch it. When you look at the sucsess that this disaster has achieved you find out how many sick minded people are in our planet(i'm not including kids under 10 here cause this can still be funny for them). 0,0001 stars out of 100.\n",

            "Rating: 7, Review: I was shown this film today without having ever read the novel for comparison of impressions. Yes, I am the one who has never read the novel. That said, I came away from the film adaptation impressed. Once one knows this is a film version of a popular book signs of it are obvious, but this is by no means necessarily a flaw. As befits the length of Harry Potter books this film is long, and that means it has the opportunity to luxuriate in introducing characters and situations while slowing building the final elements of danger into the plot. One of its greatest strengths is the detailed vast, and appealing parallel fantasy world that it creates for its characters. This comes alive both in a the writing and in the visually wonderful film-making, which shows a big budget wisely spent. There are countless brief offhand references to parts of the Wizard world which bespeak an authentically well-developed universe.\n",

So I watched it today and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees a young child find out he is a wizard and he is enrolled in a school for magic where he tries to learn more about himself.\n",
            "Rating: , Review: 'Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone' is adequate as a film but falls well short of the book. The cast is good though Daniel Radcliffe is rather green. The film however feels surprisingly by-the-numbers. A little more imagination and perhaps some risks could well have made it memorable, but it sticks to the printed text almost to the letter. While young fans will love it, adults may bemoan a missed opportunity. Still, its not all bad. Robbie Coltrane is endearing as gentle giant Hagrid, and the climax works very well. This film is a solid entertainer without ever reaching for anything higher.\n",
            "Rating: 8, Review: This is a great yarn put together very nicely on film. I think this and the second film are both excellent entertainment. They are wonderful family films although not for very small children. Any child over 8 shouldn't have any problem with these films. The acting is first rate, even by the children. Special effects are, for the most part, very well done. Somehow Fluffy just didn't seem quite real, but that didn't bother me at all. The flying scenes are wonderful. I'm waiting for the 3rd film to come out soon! Good stuff!\n",
            "Rating: 6, Review: I remember growing up and I loved the Harry Potter books I have read them all. This was a pretty good movie it was pretty close to the book but even with a two and half hour runtime it still leaves out many things and thats why the book is much better. The acting in these older ones is pretty bad too seeing how they were just child no name actors back then.\n",

            "Rating: 7, Review: It is a common practice when adapting a book to condense the book, removing anything that is unimportant. However, how can you you tell what will and will not be important when a series isn't even completely written yet? There are so many short cuts taken in this movie, little scenes and bits of dialogue taken out that you lose a sense of coherence. The characters have been simplified as well, giving us bland versions of the characters in the books. I saw this movie before reading the books and wasn't impressed. I took an interest after the second film, which is more faithful and adds some depth. This is just bright, shiny, and simple. Having said that though, the story is so good that even simplified it still works. The special effects, especially the troll, are not up to par for a major studio movie. The cast is quite good, littered with strong, veteran actors to back up the young leads. The leads are not as great in this film as they are in the sequel with a film under their belts. All in all a good effort, but the screenwriter should have stayed closer to the characters in the book and the tone of the film is light. The humor of the book is almost completely torn apart. Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets and Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban are better movies.\n",

It was funny, scary, mysterious, magical, vivid, non-stopped action sequences, magnificent effects, and awesome! The movie rules over the book, for the book was slow moving and got kind of dull for me. The director Christopher Columbus was the right choice for directing the fantasy film, who also directed my family fun films the Home Alone series. Plus, I honestly was not sure what I was reading. However, the only problem with the film was it was hokey in some places, including the troll scene in the girls bathroom. Otherwise it was well done. The second was also equally good, but I have a feeling the third one is going to be a failure to Harry Potter fans.\n",

            "Rating: 7, Review: Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone or if your from Europe the philosopher's stone. The story that started it all today marks the the films 20th anniversary. Harry Potter life changes forever when all of sudden he finds out that he's a famous wizard. So here we are at hogwarts school of witch craft and wizardry Where kids learn the fundamentals of the magic world. Here harry meets his bestest friends and from there on his life changes forever. While so much has happens in this franchise, the sorcerer's stone has alway held a top spot for me primary because of it's tone. As the the series went on each installment became more and more epic and serious. Though along with the chamber of secrets this helped build the world of Harry Potter as we know it now. This world magical and whimsical from the very first shot of hogwarts to the the great hall. Accommodate by John Williams soundtrack draw you into this setting, and looking back I can't but, love falling in love with this Cast. Not just for nostalgic feel but everybody gives a damn great performances. Especially Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint as Ron Harry and Hermione. These kid's sell the whole film from the way they play off each other to their three personalities. That moment they meet on the train you know right at that moment these three are going to be inseparable. Malfoy is such a conniving pompous little ass, you just really want to smack this boy. He's literally everything resent about his child with Dursleys cruel and Selfish. Every kid does a great job it's some of the best child acting ever. The hogwart staff are also great Maggie smith as professor Mcgonagall gives such this loving bearing grandma personality clearly someone who love her students and her job. Very strict,but is open to having fun. The late Richard Harris as Dumbledore who even though he was only in two film, I still remember his portrayal from the early content. He had this very traditional Merlin style and spoke with such a soft yet wise speaking voice. It has always made me wonder want Dumbledore would have been like if he was still around for the others films. Of course arguably everybody's favorite character in the whole series Alan Rickman as Professor Snape. Rickman clearly put his all into this character without a doubt his most famous role. He adds such this slimy malevolent charm to this character to the way he speak to the way he stares, before you even know his name you know this guy just gonna make everybody life hell. Also Hagrid I love Hagrid he such a big lovable oaf it can't be helped. While there's so much that this film has succeeded in making, it does have some gripes and minor issues. Firstly is the the pacing it does feel that in the middle of the film it can feel rather padded in a way and that primary because there's some much show and telling in the this film. It has to set up some much on how this school and this world works that it tend to seem a bit much in some parts. The Sorcerer's stone isn't mentioned until around an hour and a half in. The visuals as stated already are great from practical make and sets like the goblins and the chessboard are dedication to the craft. Though some of the cg while getting the job done for the time some does look rather off. The quidditch game make uses of it well with the field, in the game itself is epic and exciting, but when you have these fully computer generated bodies you can't help but notice them. CG is always been used for the Quidditch in these films, but here it doesn't hold up a bit as well now you can't help but just look at it.\n",

I have not read any of the books, but from what I understand, a lot of details were left out, although the movie stayed faithful to the original text.  And I appreciate that Chris Columbus did not Americanize the story, as I believe many other directors would have done.

This film is an amazing start to the franchise and it's clear to see why it garnered so much attention! It's a well made film with a loveable set off characters. My only criticism would be that it could've benefit from being a bit shorter.\n",

            "Rating: , Review: a film is not a book and shouldn't be judged on the basis of its source material. having said that, most people seeing the film will judge it against the book and there will be few complaints. The only major omission is Peeves, which shows the route the makers have taken. The film takes a strong narrative and deals soberly with the issues, never going for cheap or sentimental laughs, and is all the better for it.\n",
            "Rating: 8, Review: The first time I watched the movie I think I was the same age as the kids. I fell in love with the magic and the characters. It brings back memories of my childhood every time I rewatch. Sometimes I tear because the kids are are so little in that movie and I am in denial it was that long ago. I like the movie. Great introduction to the wizarding world.\n",
            "Rating: 5, Review: This tale, based on the popular book series, is a real accomplishment from a technical standpoint but might seem somewhat tedious to non fans of the book. Tech achievements are all excellent and the cast, both young and old, aquit themselves very well. While the film does have some outstanding sequences that keep your attention, at 2 1/2 hours the film does run a good half hour too long and often bogs down in some less than captivating sequences that slow the story down. Fans have told me that these will pay off in the sequels, but as a vieweing experience on its own, the film is just a tad too long. GRADE: B\n",

A giant named Hagrid appears, and gives Harry the all important news. He is a wizard. Now his journey in life gets more intense as he travels to Hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry to learn the trade of being a wizard. Here, he meets his friends who would be by his side for many years to come. Ron Weasley is not very brave friend and Hermione is the smart friend.

            "Rating: 10, Review: Here is the magical surprise of 2001. \"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\" is the best movie that I've seen all year (so far). This I totally did not expect. This is a film that works not only on the level of special effects. It has a terrific story, wonderful characters, and a beautiful atmosphere. This was quite refreshing since so many of the movies today that feature special effects are weak on story and characterization. \"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\" is the first movie in what is going to be a big movie series based on \"Harry Potter\" novels written by J.K. Rowling. So far four novels have been written with three more on the way. This movie has created so much hype that the second movie is already in the works. I think this is going to be a blockbuster franchise. The movie opens with the title character living with relatives that are cruel and heartless. Then Harry gets a letter from the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and learns that he's a wizard. So he gets away from his despicable uncle, aunt, and cousin, and journeys to this special school to learn the tricks of his trade. Along the way he meets two young aspiring magicians who will become his best friends, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger. He also makes an enemy in Draco Malfoy, who is kind of like the evil version of Harry. The faculty of Hogwarts include wise headmaster Albus Dumbledore; huge groundskeeper Hagrid; Prof. McGonagall, who can transform into a cat and back to human form in a flash; Prof. Snape, who's sinister looks create fear in the students; Prof. Hooch, the broomstick instructor; and Prof. Quirrell, who wears what looks like a turban all the time and studders alot. There are alot of visual elements that work wonderfully in \"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\". My favorite scene is the one where the students play the game of Quidditch. That is a fascinating special effects sequence that is kind of hard to describe but is fulfilling to watch. It kind of reminded me of the pod race in \"Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace\" with its effects going across the screen at a rapid pace. Another great scene in the movie is the one where the three kids play an unusual high stakes game of chess, where the huge game pieces come to life. \"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\" works on every level. In addition to the excellent special effects, it works on the direction and screenplay. The director here is Chris Columbus, who's worked in this territory before as the director of the popular kids- oriented 1990 comedy \"Home Alone\" and its first sequel, 1992's \"Home Alone 2: Lost in New York\". He worked with kids again in the little more adult oriented 1993 Robin Williams blockbuster \"Mrs. Doubtfire\". These three hit movies directed by Columbus were more lighthearted in its tone, but Columbus has been in more darker territory before. His directorial debut came with \"Adventures in Babysitting\", the black comedy from 1987 that was filmed in Chicago and starred Elisabeth Shue. Before stepping into the director's chair, Columbus wrote a couple of screenplay's for a trio of Steven Spielberg productions: \"Gremlins\", \"The Goonies\", and \"Young Sherlock Holmes\". \"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\" bares a resemblance to each one of those movies in some way. Those virtuoso special effects scenes when those big chess pieces comes to life was very much like some of the special effects scenes in \"Young Sherlock Holmes\". This movie is like an \"Indiana Jones\" for kids; so was \"The Goonies\". This movie is scary and darker in tone; so was \"Gremlins\". Though unlike \"Gremlins\", \"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\" isn't violent. It's scary, but not over-the-line scary. Columbus was a good choice as director of this movie (Steven Spielberg had a chance to direct this, but passed on it to make \"A.I.\"), and it's his best film as director to date. He's brought this movie to life in exhilarating fashion. The screenplay is by Oscar nominee Steve Kloves (\"Wonder Boys\"), who did a superb job in adapting the movie from the book. The cinematography, editing, production design, and costume design are all first-rate and deserve Oscar attention, along with the visual effects. The performances are picture perfect. The three kids who play Harry, Ron, and Hermione are all acting newcomers and they were all perfect choices to play these characters. I think we'll be seeing alot of Daniel Radcliffe in the future. Radcliffe portrays Harry Potter to absolute perfection. He holds the movie together in every scene, and was a natural choice to play this character. Rupert Grint and Emma Watson are very exceptional as Ron and Hermione. Like Radcliffe, we'll be seeing alot of Grint and Watson for years to come. They're all terrific young British actors (and they've all been signed on to star in the next \"Harry Potter\" movie). You couldn't have asked for a better supporting cast than the one that's featured in this movie, all a who's who of veteran British actors. Richard Harris (as headmaster Dumbledore), Maggie Smith (Prof. McGonagall), Alan Rickman (Prof. Snape), Robbie Coltrane (groudskeeper Hagrid), Zoe Wanamaker (Prof. Hooch), and Ian Hart (Prof. Quirrell) are all perfectly cast; with John Cleese, Warwick Davis, Richard Griffiths, John Hurt, Fiona Shaw, and Julie Walters featured in smaller roles. What a cast! I loved everything about \"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\". This is not just a movie for kids, but for the whole family. I've never read any of the \"Harry Potter\" books, but on the basis of this first \"Harry Potter\" movie, I think I'm going to go out and purchase the books. Or maybe ask to receive them as a Christmas gift. Speaking of Christmas, I think \"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\" will be the smash hit of the Christmas season 2001. If it doesn't surpass last year's Christmas hit, \"Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas\" (which opened at exactly the same time a year ago), then the American moviegoing public has completely lost it. \"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\" has gotten far better reviews that \"The Grinch\" movie did last year, and critically acclaimed movies deserve to be blockbuster hits alot more than critically hated movies like \"The Grinch\". From what I saw this weekend (a packed moviehouse and an opening day gross of $29.5 million), \"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\" will be a blockbuster smash. BET ON IT!!!!!\n",

            "Rating: 6, Review: It certainly wasn't an easy task Chris Columbus took upon himself when he started working on adapting one of the most loved novels ever for the screen. I have to say that I was among those who felt almost upset when I heard that Columbus would direct the movie -- Home Alone, need I say more? I was doubtful if Columbus would be capable to go to darker places. I am happy to say that Columbus has stayed true to the source material in most ways. Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone is a rather dark movie considering that it is a children's film. Luckily, there are some comic scenes as well -- though not nearly as many as in the book.\n",
            "Rating: 7, Review: So far, the film has been well received by its young fans and most critics. Some critics and myself are less enthusiastic. Indeed, a friend of mine who has read the book was quick to point out that it was made simpler and more childish. If only director Chris Columbus and screenwriter Steve Kloves had done their jobs as well as the set designers, cast and visual effects people, this would have been the film of the year. As it stands, it is reduced to a moderately entertaining diversion which probably doesnt even warrant cinematic viewing. And to think it began so well, showing strong signs of plot development. Sadly, it starts to go downhill not long after Harry arrives at Hogwarts.\n",

            "Rating: 1, Review: I've read the book only to see what all the hype's about. I must admit I was pleasantly surprised. It was a very easy book to follow and dares to be nothing more than it actually is - a plain old nothing-new-under-the-sun children's book. In that, Rowling did a fine job. Snippets from Lord of the Rings, Dracula, Ender's Game, to name a few, were bluntly used throughout the book and meshed together to form this trashy, 2 cents of a fantasy story. Oh well, as long as it keeps my children reading.\n",

Never happened though, and I committed myself to watching the first movie in the DVD Boxset which I gave my girlfriend for her Christmas.\n",
            "Rating: 6, Review: How can you not root for Harry Potter?  In one scene, we establish him as the 2nd saddest child in cinematic history (the saddest being Charlie from Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory): seeing a kid drawing his own birthday cake in dirt.  My God, I was practically traumatized watching this. The first 30 minutes of child abuse was crushing my poor heart, and then the cake scene.  I honestly wouldn't have objected to Harry becoming a hatchet murderer at that point--you couldn't have made me side against him. So, to witness him go on and discover his roots in magic, and actually find happiness in that world?  I was all for it....but I still wanted to beat the tar out of the Dursleys.\n",
            "Rating: 1, Review: This film is simply awful, the acting is a joke. Being a fan of the book I decided to buy the DVD without seeing at the cinema or renting it before, but I was extremely dissapointed. Daniel Radcliff's acting is terrible, in my honest opinion he was only hired because he looks like the illustrations of Harry Potter and he is definatly what I had pictured in my mind but his acting makes a mockery out of the film and turns it into a spoof of the book, instead of bringing it to life. I definatly won't be rushing to the shops to get the second film too soon.\n",

            "Rating: 1, Review: African-Americans have FUBU, kids have the Harry Potter movies (I should take that back so Black America doesn't hunt me down for the insulting comparison). If you're under 8 and dig witchcraft, or you really like bad (and I mean BAD) acting in a high-budget movie, you might love it. If, however, your intellectual age is over 12, I would recommend avoiding this terribly long, drawn-out exhibition of children's sorcery -- WORST movie I've ever sat through in the theater. Yes, worse than \"Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil\" and even \"Master of Disguise.\" The first hour, at least I had a bucket of popcorn to keep my interest. When it wasn't over after 90 minutes, I tried to take a nap but my bucket of cherry coke had me wired. My friend seemed to be enjoying it, so I tried to give it a chance. By the 2-hour mark, I wanted to commit suicide, but the theater apparently expected this reaction and restricted me from bringing in any weapons. I decided to stay and avoid the traffic, so I clipped my finger nails and toe nails (I guess if someone can hijack an airplane with clippers, I could have done some much-needed damage to myself, but I didn't think about that at the time). People really need to stop saying it's a movie to be enjoyed by everyone. There's a reason almost half of the reviews are saying everything from overrated to worst movie of all time. Guess where I stand.\n",

            "Rating: 6, Review: I used to, in fact I still do, love fantasy films for example Labyrinth, Masters of the universe, Princess bride and of course the first three star wars films. Fantasy films have the most imaginative of set designs and costumes and when done well take you to another world for 90 or so minutes. Since the 80's these films have dried up, very rarely are they released and even rarer now are they good. The last I can remember was Phantom Menace but that wasn't great, plus there is an overuse of effects to, I like to see an actor walking on a set for real. All of a sudden Harry Potter comes out which will be quickly followed by Lord of the rings. I went not knowing what to expect, I had heard 99% excellent reviews, but would this sort of film still appeal to me? answer yes. This film gets the balance between kids fun and subtley included adult jokes perfectly, it has moments of universal joy and the set designs are brilliant as are the effects, the effects thankfully are not overused either. Most films of this type would have an adult in the lead for the purpose really of experienced acting skills despite a child being more accessible for the younger audience, but thankfully the three principle child actors are good in their roles, the supporting cast of the younger generation range from average to quite wooden but they will get better with age. As a critic said the three main kids are not portrayed as to cutsie like the case might have been, aside from their magical skills they are seemingly you average run of the mill kids you see every day in the highstreet or whatever. Basically this film has a universal appeal and I would say is the first decent non cartoon fantasy of the 90's. Its solid entertainment. ***\n",

            "Rating: 8, Review: To put it simply, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is a great way to start a francise, a way to find out what works and what doesn't. It's very similar to what Confused Matthew said about the first Spider Man and the Star Trek Reboot, a film to find out how to make the rest of the series will work. The film overrall is great, but since it's the first film, there are a few problems, like the child actors. I mean, compared to most child actors, their frekin amazing, but let's be happy that they got better as the series went on. Plus some of the special effects didn't age well, such as the troll scene.

            "Rating: , Review: Co-star Richard Harris said of the book, \"It's not my cup of tea.\"  This from a man who has probably read ever great novel and performed every great play written.  In other words, her prefers stories which stick to the ribs as opposed to cotton candy which will melt away in the shadow of adulthood. For a blockbuster film filled with special effects HARRY POTTER has surprising zilch to offer as far as groundbreaking cinema.  We've all seen films about magic, broomstick flying, monsters, etc... and though the production values are far beyond that of a CHITTY CHITTY BANG BANG, they are not beyond that of SUPERMAN, and the story falls far from the film perfection of a MARY POPPINS or the classic literacy of C.S.Lewis.  The acting by the youngsters get the job done but don't expect to see much more of them (except for sequels), and the older famous counterparts give their usual professional turns that seem to be lifted from previous roles.  In essence, the hype of the books have carried over to carry the film.  The story line pales against the classics and there goes the real story.  Most college students would have a difficult time reading the classics by Verne, Stevenson, Homer, Melville(the original versions), and Harry Potter (a step above Dr. Seuss, but without the wit or satire) gives students a chance to say they have actually read a book that wasn't a comic book.  HARRY POTTER will be forgotten before the next generation arrives and be buried alongside PIPPY LONGSTOCKING in the LET'S-NOT-ADMIT-WE-ACTUALLY-ENJOYED-THIS crypt of forgotten lore.  But back to HARRY POTTER, a muddy muddle of a movie. England has never looked more drab, magic has never looked more insignificant, and Brits have never looked more stupid.  Chris Columbus, who did a terrific job with YOUNG SHERLOCK HOLMES shows none of the imagination he showed in that film.  Trimmed by an hour this film would be a nice diversion on children's TV, but as a cinematic event, it falls way too short.\n",

Well, all I have to say is that \"The Sorcerer's Stone\" was actually one of the best movies I have ever seen. The movie was a perfect adaptation of this famous, and classic book, and every single member of the cast was brilliant in every way, and they are really impressing characters. It's also an excellent movie with one of the most excellent visual effects, that made the movie look like magic really does exist. And it has an interesting storyline, provided with excellent music. Well, I think this movie, and other films in the series, are actually films to die for. These movies are visual and charming, and they never stop to entertain, and the very first chapter is one of my personal favorites, and never disappoints. Since being a old childhood favorite, I can watch this movie over and over again, and I'm still amazed at how I'm transported from the real world to this magical wizarding world. I think if you never saw these movies before, then you are a failure at life.

By some magic of her own, the author of these books has ensnared an entire planet into reading works written for children. But thats all they are, regardless of how many pages it takes to tell the story. It is our own disappointment in this realiziation that the movie somehow brings home, and that has bred the general chagrin amongst most viewers. Most adult viewers that is. I daresay you won't get a negative review from anyone under the age of 12. But if you have devoted weeks towards reading children's literature and then feel empty when the motion picture doesnt live up to your expectations, well more's the pity. Next time read Dickens!\n",

Enough people give a product their stamp of approval that it nearly becomes propaganda. No person can escape at least making a decision about that product.

The settings, wardrobes, and props all carry ample weight in producing a magical atmosphere. Meanwhile, the iconic music sets an adventurous and mystical tone. Lastly, the casting is excellent. Most of the adults are extremely talented (namely Alan Rickman) and the children, despite their novice here, all became quite respected in their own rights. Together, this establishes a foundation for the franchise to build on.\n",

I use to when I was younger, but I find that at my age works of the printed word rarely raise my interest.  Then one day, someone gave me a Potter book, and I was hooked instantly on the characters and the imagination of JK Rowling's world.  I have read all 4.\n",

            "Rating: 6, Review: Seeing as how we have reached the end of this franchise after 10 very enjoyable years, I think it's time to reflect on how well the series will stand the test of time. Upon hearing that they where making a movie adaptation of \"Harry Potter\", I was not really affected. I was 9 years old and unfamiliar with the story. My father had read the books to me here and there, and only after I saw the 4th movie did I really get into this franchise and decided to pick up the books myself.\n",

The school game Spinach or whatever threatens to bring the film to life after a long wait and has a great other-wordly quality to it. It doesn't last.

            "Rating: 6, Review: Somehow I hadn't watched any Harry Potter movies until now. The story is fine at best, but the acting and effects are really corny and took me out of most of the film. Of course though, this is only the first movie, and I know it gets better from here.\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: I saw this movie first before reading the books and walked away very impressed. The sheer imagination that came with this movie amazed me the story is wonderfully written a kids movie that does not dumb itself down to it's audience. Daniel Radcliffe's acting is a little stiff a little wooden but not overly all considering the fact that he was not a acting expert when he started he manages to do very well. Richard Harris THE man who was born to be Dumbledore I can't imagine anyone else in this role even his eventual replacement in the prisoner of azkaban does not measure up to him. And Robbie Coltrane the heart of the series his Hagrid is a joy to watch as is Emma Watson who is outstanding as Herimone Granger. This movie is a treat and deserves to be watched again and again and in years to come I'm sure it'll be labeled a Classic.\n",
            "Rating: 7, Review: Since the novel's 1997 release, the buzz about a film adaptation of Philosopher's Stone was abounds. It wasn't until 2001 when Potterheads' dreams came true, and the book's film adaptation came out, sending fans to the cinemas in droves. Since the film's release and foretold box office success, the series has gone on to have the whole book series adapted, including the most successful adaptation, the newest one, Deathly Hallows Part 2. Since all the movies are out, I figured it would be nice to let my inner Potterhead put the nostalgia to the test. \n",
            "Rating: 8, Review: By the 2000 Sidney Olympics, my country of Portugal had a contestant in the shooting class. It is a sport that requires a lot of concentration and clod blood. So, the athlete has to keep calm. In the TV I saw him shooting and looking down between shots. But he wasn't just looking down. He was reading \"Harry Potter\". When I was confronted with the opening of this movie, I wasn't really interested, thought it was too childish. But thenm there had to be a reason why the books appealed to children, adults, everyone. So when inevitably I saw this one, the result was an instant feeling of empathy towards it. I can only say that if they are trying to charm the viewer, if they are trying to involve him in the movie's sheer magic, they succeeded all the way. Now I understand why this one has so many fans. It is simply irresistible. It gives you something that you always search for when you go watch a movie - the power to be in another place for a few hours. And the movie delivers this and many more: all the production values are epic and magnificent, the John Williams score being a sort of conductor of all the emotions you experience when seeing this. The definition of movie magic doesn't come any closer than this! This movie makes you a child again, and thus it is unmissable.\n",
            "Rating: 8, Review: I have not read any of the Harry Potter books and until now had not seen any of the films, and also tbh it's not a series I really know much about - so I went into this film pretty much completely blind. I have to say that it is really entertaining, and I would have loved it if it had come out when I was a kid. Following an 11yo Harry as he discovers that he is a wizard, it's off to wizard school he goes and we are treated to a collection of interesting teachers, fantastic beasts, moving staircases and secrets aplenty. With an engaging plot and great characters, this is a film that is extremely hard to dislike. I look forward to watching the rest...\n",
            "Rating: 8, Review: This is still my personal Potter favorite. The Sorcerer's Stone is still the film that opened my eyes to the world of young wizards and witchcraft. Its sequels are worth recommending, but it becomes increasingly less magical and wondrous. No matter how great a film is, it's rare for the film to capture fully the essence of the book. Harry Potter is no exception. This is the work and imagination of the filmmakers themselves, not necessarily what we believe it should be. Another director could have seen the world of Harry Potter in a different light.\n",
            "Rating: 8, Review: Daniel Radcliffe makes a superb debut as the young Wizard, ably supported by Emma Watson, Rupert Grint and a host of legendary British actors. Robbie Coltrane makes for a memorable Hagrid with Maggie Smith and Alan Rickman also on fine form. The films real triumph however is bringing to life with great gusto and in intricate detail the rich fantasy world created by the magnificent imagination of J K Rowling. The soundtrack has become as memorable as the bond theme. A triumph all round.\n",

            "Rating: 8, Review: Beautiful movie. Great casting. Wonderful costumes. Over the top score. Curious editing.  They just tried too hard.  I didn't feel at all like i was watching a movie.

            "Rating: 8, Review: I am an avid fan of the Harry Potter series. I have read every book, seen every movie, and tried to find out everything there is to know about the series. Well, this is the first book, and movie, of the series. It is safe to say that this is a wonderful beginning to the series of Harry Potter movies. This kept to the book quite nicely. Not much seemed to be cut, aside from some minor situations and events, although it is quite sad to see a character like Peeves the Poltergeist to be on the cutting room floor. To be honest, I saw this film when I was quite young, and I thought that all of the characters fit J.K. Rowling's descriptions perfectly. Now older, I feel the same way, but that may be because your childhood memories are memorable.\n",

Firstly, the plot is great, it family film, but also it has detective and a little bit horror aspects. It has moral: friendship (and love) is most powerful thing in the world.

            "Rating: 7, Review: \"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone\" (Or Sorcerer's stone depending on your region) introduces a complicated world filled with a lot of ideas and characters. It isn't perfect and it's obvious that as the first instalment, it was unclear to the director and screenwriter as to what would work and what wouldn't. Sometimes it follows the novel too closely with some characters and ideas that overall could have been left out (the ghosts for example, do not play an important part in this first story) and at times it's awkward to have us bounce quickly in-between all of the classes the students attend. However, it does a good job of introducing us to this world, it has a lot of really memorable moments, a great cast and there's a lot of imagination here (some from the movie, some from the original book). I wouldn't say that my love for the Harry Potter series, both the films and the books influence me when I say that this is a good movie. It's a humble beginning to a series of films that's sure to become essential viewing and a lot of people's favourite for years to come. (Theatrical version on the big screen, August 17, 2012)\n",

All the magical sets and props made the Wizarding World of Harry Potter feel real and made so many kids and adults fall in love with this movie franchise. Even ignoring the best part of this movie, the story and the plot, I still find The Philosopher's Stone spectacular in every single element. It's impressive how perfect the screenplay is and how accurately all the small details are explained.\n",

Anyway, I kept wishing I was 10 years old when I saw this, because I would have enjoyed it more.

Derived from these was a trifecta of blockbuster potential and surely enough, we are five, nearly six, films through her saga.

Add in an almost dead on adaptation of the phenomenal novel, 3 nice showings from the young kids, and an excellent supporting cast, 'Sorcerer's Stone' is a winner.\n",

The book was brilliant, and this film was as good, or if not better than the novel. The actors did a great job, even the young trio proved themselves worthwhile. The special effects were brilliant and Chris Colombus easily proved to us that he was the perfect director for the Harry Potter series.\n",

            "Rating: 6, Review: For a book adaptation, \"Harry Potter and the Socerer's/Philosopher's  stone\" is a fairly good effort. It remains as faithful to the book as possible, and leaves out very little in term of story. Unfortunately, it DOES leave out most of the humour of the book (which was to be expected, you simply can't put all those funny descriptions in the movie), but it sadly doesn't replace them with much else.\n",
            "Rating: 8, Review: I have watched Harry Potter and its stars grow from adolescence to adulthood. This is the beginning of the journey. And I would say that Potter got off to a good start. The Sorcerer's Stone is full of neat visuals and charming characters. Though I have never read the novel, I can tell from this adaptation that it is a pleasant read. The young actors are also excellent here, unlike most child actors who rely solely on their age in order to give them the passing grade. It is a fun, yet flawed adventure bound to please young and old alike with its magical charms and a keen sense of adventure, wonder, mystery, and of course magic.\n",
            "Rating: 6, Review: Chris Columbus has mostly directed movies for the whole family. His imprint is clear. The first Harry Potter movie is clearly a very childlike fantasy. It's mostly aimed for children, and no one's trying to hide it. Sure, people of all ages can watch it, and the book isn't just meant for kids, but the movie is just so clearly meant for children, which can make it slightly annoying. But it's fascinating to see how that changes when the series goes on. The movies change a lot considering their target audience was growing up the whole time, and they eventually look like a dark young adult fantasy instead of this colourful fantasy for children..\n",
            "Rating: 7, Review: This was a really well done movie. I was really intrigued to see how well they would portray the book on film and I must say, they did a fantastic job. There were undoubtedly some major and minor differences but I felt almost all of these were perfectly fine. Obviously it's impossible to include every aspect but there were some things that I think they could've/should've done differently. For one, I understand you can't add everything and that some things might have to be changed in order to make the movie work but if that's the case, why add things that are completely unnecessary? For example, the moving stairs. As for the things taken out or changes, I have no problem with all of them, except one. In the end when they're making their way through the various challenges, they took out Snape's potion riddle. To me, that was the second most important and memorable challenge of them all behind the chess challenge. This would've only added another minute or two and should've been included in the movie. Nonetheless, this was a well done book-to-movie adaptation. The acting of some of the students left a little to be desired but it wasn't too bad and I've heard it improves as they, and the book/movies age.\n",
            "Rating: 1, Review: For a start, the correct title of the book is 'Harry Potter and the PHILOSOPHER'S Stone'. Could the retitling of the film have anything to do with the fact that the only audience for this film is actually too dense to have any clue in hell as to what a philosopher is, or for that matter, be able to read it. I think that it's time for a lesson in language from Yodapoo:\n",
            "Rating: 7, Review: Now, there was an extremely high amount of hype about the Harry Potter movies when they announced they were going to make it in to a movie and Fans all around the world were hoping that unlike most screen adapted books that they would keep the magic of the book inside. Now, when I saw it, I was more relieved then anything, I went in expecting the worst out of it and it was only really watching it on DVD for the first time that I realized that it really was a great movie and apart from a horrible habit of overacting on Hermoines (Forgive Speeling)part it was held together excellently. Another thing, Daniel Radcliffe did one of the best child actors performances ever as he was Harry Potter, he was not the actor playing Harry Potter but he was actually Harry Potter. I also think the actor playing Ron (Ruprint Grint) is an excellent addition to the class and does well as Harry's sidekick during the film. I think all fans of the Harry Potter books will love this film and the many sequels that followed and even though the acting skills of Hermoine had not yet developed, they got there. I rate this film 73%. GO HARRY POTTER.\n",

            "Rating: 6, Review: I came to the film without having read the books. I had heard the movie followed slavishly to the novel but I reckoned if the movie was good enough, that shouldn't matter. So did the film feel like the adaption of a novel? Yes, very much so. It's obvious director Chris Columbus was scared of doing anything too radical with the material and so the movie tends to get bogged down at times. Certain elements in books do not translate well to movies unless done with a bit of flair - Columbus doesn't do this and so there is a certain weakness to the movie's structure. The acting isn't outstanding either among the kids. Daniel Radcliffe left as much of an impression on me as a battering with a soft feather would. It's not like he's from the dreadful Jake \"Phantom Menace\" Lloyd school of acting but he's entirely unremarkable all the same. Very forgettable performance. Rupert Grint (Ron) and Emma Watson (Hermione) are similarly perfunctionary and nothing more. The best performance is probably shared by Alan Rickman (Severus Snape) and Robbie Coltrane (Hagrid) who really come across exactly what I would imagine from a kids book. The directing is perfectly competent and some of the action scenes are handled well - the quidditch match stands out most of all. Obviously Columbus was constrained by the material at hand and the target audience - I was hardly expecting to see Darren Aronofsky split-screen images of Hermione and Harry talking... The whole thing ends up like a well-done but by-the-numbers piece. No innovation here, no gambles. It was made to be as inoffensive as possible while trying to please as many. It's too long and could do with some pruning but in the end you're still left with an enjoyable movie. Just not a particularly brilliant one. 6.5/10\n",

I feel I have an advantage in that I do not know the complete Harry Potter story, making it quite new' to a viewer like me. This movie also shows me why Harry Potter is so popular with Children, as its story is directed right at that viewing audience. There is also an uncanny comparison to 'The Wizard of Oz' and 'Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone'. Be captivated by the world's most popular mythical character, who has come to life! \n",

Haven't read any of the books, but I'm keeping abreast of the movies, and looking forward to the next phase for Harry Potter.  The young man who portrays Harry Potter is a good actor and very engaging.  His facial expressions are so natural with each emotion.  Story and music are also beautiful!\n",

            "Rating: 7, Review: This movie, about an orphaned boy who enrolls in a school of wizardry, where he learns the truth about himself, his family and the terrible evil that haunts the magical world, is a good beginning to the Harry Potter octalogy (2001-2011). I really love the first half, especially the scenes with the Dursleys because they have such a hilarious relationship with Harry Potter. I also love the first scenes of Hogwarts, which was a mysterious welcome. Almost every second scene is iconic! The production design and the music often make the scenes very interesting and strange, and you can really feel the magic! Also the script is great, especially the funny parts. I think the story is good, but not just the story about Harry living at the school in general, but the ones about his parents, Albus Dumbledore, Voldemort, Severus Snape and the dark places. All of these characters and elements make a complex story, which is well done, I think. Daniel Radcliffe (as Harry Potter) and Rupert Grint (as Ron Weasley) played decent, but I think Emma Watson (as Hermione Granger) did the best of the child actors. She really held onto her character. I liked the second half of the movie, but most of it contained the usual adventure and mystery scenes like other movies when it comes to open locked doors, find keys, solve puzzles, and face the danger in a brave way. Good scenes, but not fantastic, I think. So overall, an iconic movie with an interesting story with fantastic and funny characters that lead you into a magic and mysterious world!\n",

The performances, the script and the special effects were good enough, not as good as better films as \"Avatar\" and \"Watchmen\", but were good. My only problem with all the Harry Potter films is that all of those movies are pretty long. Since those book and movies are aimed to children they should be shorter, I guess. All the Harry Potter films are good, but I still prefer \"Avatar\", because \"Avatar\" has aliens, and I love aliens.\n",

            "Rating: 10, Review: There are well over 1,100 comments preceding thus one. Everything from praise to condemnation has already been voiced. So why another comment? Why not? The film isn't faithful to the text of the book, though it's fairly faithful to the spirit behind the book. As the opening of the Harry Potter saga, a lot of the film, as with the book, is introducing newcomers to the world of the young wizard. Meeting the characters -- Harrym Hagridm Ron, Hermione, and the like -- is important, and in the film, they're fairly well established. The whole magical world of Wizardkind is introduced, but shortcuts had to be made.\n",
            "Rating: 7, Review: I'm a bit disappointed with this film, even I'm exciting because Harry Potter is made in film. Sometime part in the novel is not in the film, end the ending was so simple (not like in the novel). But the film  is good enough to see. And they choose right persons to act in this film. They all good to play their character and must be proud, because they choose right film too to start they're new step to be a little super star (for all who play Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Draco).\n",

            "Rating: 7, Review: Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is the start of the Harry Potter movie series- which is an excellent series, by the way! This one starts Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter, a young orphan boy, living with his grandparents. He discovers that he is a wizard, and is being sent to Hogwarts: School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. His grandparents are reluctant to send him, but luckily, Hagrid comes and takes Harry to his new school. Unfourtunatley, Voldemort (He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named) the man who killed Harry's parents is lurking about the school, searching for Harry.\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: This film was done so well and catches all the essence of the book in my opinion. This is a film that I sometimes recommend people to read before the book just to get a real visual of the world and then dive into the books otherwise the books can be overwhelming to try to imagine the world. Oh, and have the movie and reading the books - don't forget your trip to Universal to walk into the world! Amazing, don't miss HP series!\n",
            "Rating: 8, Review: I am not a fan of books. Literature and History are the subjects I fear the most. With Harry Potter too, until now, I have not touched any Harry Potter books. I want to apologize to author J. K. Rowling, but it's true. Without this movie, I would never have known who Harry Potter was. But this is the magic of movies. The year Harry Potter part 1 came out, I was lucky enough to see it, via the 2-part VCD. Harry Potter was my age when I saw the movie. And my forehead is scarred too, but not by the Dark Lord lol but by my dad, in a drunken stupor. I am also nearsighted like Harry, this movie became one of the lights of my childhood. To this day, I can't remember how many times I've watched this movie over and over again. And I've never been bored. Of course, because it is a movie for children, the details and content of the film are very innocent and gentle, not too violent. And the film also has absurd errors like, why is the Sorcerer Stone in Harry's pocket? The explanation is easy, because this is the world of magic. Ok I give up. Like I said, generations of families have grown up with this movie, and I'm lucky to be part of the Harry Potter fandom.\n",

            "Rating: 4, Review: I suppose as children's entertainment this film could be called good, but to anyone with a brain it is a messy, overindulged concoction of bad ideas and silly execution. I know nothing of the Potter books so this is based simply on the film. So much has been made of the books and film that I was predestined to be disappointed in some ways but little did I realize how trivial this movie is when cast against a powerhouse like The Lord of the Rings, really two completely different worlds. As with most modern tales of this type (HP) everything is so magical, everything moves (in some ways stupidly like the changing staircases) and it seemed so simple that no matter what issue that came up they all had an answer for everything. The worst part of the movie had to be the game played with balls and broomsticks. The whole point of having a separate game within a game is just retarded. Name one sport or game that has a special sideshow that can win the game at any moment? Imagine your team is about to win the Stanley Cup and their up 3 games to 1 and it's 4-0 with only a minute to go, but wait, don't forget there's a fan from each team playing a separate game in the men's room, and they just caught the golden plunger, so sorry your team has lost, too bad. Seems like JK's writing is a little on the light end don't you think? Why didn't the professor who is already through to the stone need to play the chess game like they did? What adults would announce the winners of a year long contest that meant so much to the kids, then seconds later say \"but wait, there's points that I forgot about\"??? How cruel. Very childish and overrated.\n",
            "Rating: 9, Review: I went into this movie somewhat concerned about whether the subject matter would be offensive to me or anyone else who took religion seriously. I am quite aware that in western culture we tend to overlook many issues that conflict with historical (and conservative) religious viewpoints. Halloween would be a great example.\n",
            "Rating: 9, Review: Growing up the Harry Potter movies were my go to. Road trips, movie nights, rainy nights at the camp Harry Potter was always involved. This is my first time watching them as and adult and they still give me the same joyous feeling I had as a kid.\n",
            "Rating: 9, Review: To bring the Harry Potter books to life is no easy feat, and but this movie does it brilliantly. I realize a few things were left out of the movie but that is understandable. To think they did this great of a job with child actors, too. It's very easy to fall in love with this movie.\n",
            "Rating: 5, Review: I didn't even read the book(s) and I still really liked this movie. The movie is about a young wizard named Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe). He is then enrolled in a school called Hogwarts, if I remember. He then befriends two other fellow students, Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson). Then Harry learns about this magical stone called the Sorcerer's Stone and the three of them go out to search for it. I thought the movie was quite good. The special effects were pretty good. Acting well, it was good but was not bad. The only real problem I had with the movie was understanding the character names and remembering their names and who they were. Other than that it is a great film. I no doubt recommend this movie to all.\n",
            "Rating: 8, Review: Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (or Sorcerer's Stone) entertains and remains with the audience after the mere \"pop-corn experience\". Basically the movie is a very pleasing delight and it is magnified more so by the lack of quality movies in the summer (and early fall) of 2001. This (perhaps), along with the huge following of the books, led to its huge opening and then rather precipitous collapse at the box office.\n",
            "Rating: 6, Review: I am probably one in a minority when I say that I do not like Harry Potter. I thought it was overlong and a tad bit boring, it was however funny in places. I also liked the quote at the end where Harry says \"I am not going home not really\". Harry Potter was released alongside Lord of the Ring, I saw both I preferred LOTR. I don't however hate all of the Harry Potter films, I thought the Prisoner of Azkaban was good and so was the Goblet of fire.\n",

Well, on a whim I decided to rent the movie and give it a look, and boy was I surprised. It was great.\n",
            "Rating: , Review: Harry Potter is a really fun movie for anyone and everyone.  This is the first fantasy movie that's come out in a long time.  This is what the kid's have been waiting for. 7.5 out of 10.\n",

I make my own mind up and often of not critics get it wrong for me. seeing many bad reviews on here humours me, i mean its the usual suspects, people that love the books all say that its not the same as the books, people into magic say its not proper magic dah dah dah. Having said that what do i think of this spectacle?\n",
            "Rating: 5, Review: Well today, I finally caved in and saw this movie. For starters I'm sick and tired about \"Harry Potter\". What I saw was just as I was expecting for a very big hyped movie. The movie itself had a very small plot(mainly Harry's first year at special school for wizards) and a small subplot about a special stone. This acting at times seems very wooden from both the actors, the extras etc. There is special effects overkill in this movie.\n",
            "Rating: 3, Review: I remember myself trying to watch this movie back in 2001-2002 and never completing it. I decided to give it one more chance with an open minded glance...However, I got disappointed one more time... Even if you are expecting to watch a fictional adventure with magic, away from reality, not even basic logic is followed. Things are predictable, scenario is lame and rationalism is absent. I give 3 out of 10 because of scenery (still skeptical if it really deserves it). Cannot figure out how this movie became such a success\n",
            "Rating: 8, Review: This is a wonderful and very enjoyable introduction to the wizarding world of Harry Potter, and the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. I've never read the books, but the world presented to us is rich in detail, and just sucks you in, in a very comfortable and inviting way.\n",
            "Rating: 7, Review: I'll start by saying these types of films generally are not my jam. With the exception of Never ending story (1984) was never really into fantasy films. My friend convinced me to give it a go saying I might like it. Overall I was pretty impressed. The story was good, as was the direction, effects and the acting. I tend to have difficulty with movies over a 2 hr mark as I often find they use filler vs substance but that wasn't the case here, each scene was a proper progression to the story. I guess the only real detractors are I think the quidditch scene runs a little long, and wouldn't technically Harry be expelled for going into the restricted section and taking on Voldemort as a entry level wizard. That aside a really good film 4/5.\n",

            "Rating: 6, Review: First off- I really, really enjoyed this movie. Very much. It had the same feeling of the book(s) but of course it couldn't cover as much as the book could (it would be near impossible to do it). For instance, a lot of the characters didn't have as much screen time as they are mentioned in the book. (It seems that Snape, Quirrell, George, Fred and Percy Weasly had bigger roles; and Hedwig, I can't even remember the name being mentioned) But really, that doesn't matter. What matters is that the movie is good or not, and it is.\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: The most amazing story of all time. I'm doubtful but excited to see if there is any writer that can come close to what JKR did with Harry Potter.

            "Rating: 10, Review: I really enjoyed this film. It was entertaining, and very fun to watch. I haven't read the books, so it was a fresh start to Harry Potter. It was funny, exciting, and great for everyone in the theatre I went to too. The cinematography, and special effects were nice too. I think that Emma Watson was really great, and Rupert Grint was very funny. There was a good lot of humour in this film, and I think everyone should watch it!\n",
            "Rating: 8, Review: This film truly captured me into the magical world created. Diagon Alley is such a cool place and seeing Hogwarts is breathtaking. I also like a good villain in films and Draco Malfoy definitely seems like a good antagonist, such a cool character.\n",
            "Rating: 9, Review: The ultimate children's fantasy film, filled with magic, mystery and masterful storytelling. The kids are brilliantly cast, complementing the who's who of British acting. The special effects have started to look a bit tired, but it is hard to criticise such a crowd pleaser. The secret winner of the Harry saga is John Williams, who adds another perfect soundtrack to his impressive resume. 9/10.\n",
            "Rating: 3, Review: This film is none other than the awful copy of the lord of the rings and Chronicles of Narnia. E 'un film certainly derivative, was given the opportunity to write yet another bullshit that the lord of the rings is overvalued, I would say the opposite, Harry potter is a novel for children tremendously overvalued. After the lord of the rings is the novel for excellence and fantasy film series has had more than 13 Oscar. It's a excellent series. then the criticism written by ignorant idiot can be quite clear, are the usual senseless words of those who took up with the moon across. It 'a film that has a great relationship with the occult and magic and has a few meanings and moral lessons suitable for the growth of children. Punta much about these schools for Maghetti really irritating and disturbing. It 'a film for children, with no spectacular worthy of note and I know a lack narrative in the film. The criticism she has received are justified and fair, a film is terribly derivative and constitutes one of the bases levels of film fantasy films.\n",
            "Rating: 4, Review: The magic is still there don't get me wrong, but the storytelling is just not good. I was one of the kids that grew up on these movies, I rewatched them all, all the time and there is a lot of nostalgia towards them. Is the magic gone? Not completely, but has it faded a bit? Definitely. Chris Columbus captured the magical kids dream of going to an unknown world, learning magic, seeing and doing things you wished you could, but in a fragmented way that works wonders for a kid's movie but doesn't speak to the adult storyteller in me.\n",

            "Rating: 10, Review: I have previously posted a review for this film and I felt it wasn't long enough to show how much I enjoyed this film.At the time I typed that review,I had no idea what to put down.First of all,I would like to mention that \"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\" is a film for the entire family and is almost 2hrs,30min or a little less of pure family entertainment.This film is enchanting in every way,providing excitement and fantasy for an entire audience and a is very surprisingly fun film to watch due to it's casting.I have never read any of the \"Harry Potter\" books because I knew that they were so big I would never catch up.The same thing with \"Superman:The Movie\".Never read the comics,although I looked at the pictures.Well,I read some of the comics but not all of them.I usually do not compare films to the novels or comics that they were adapted from because it wouldn't make sense for me.So I look at a book as a book and a movie as a movie.Alright,so far \"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\" attracted alot of audience members and is the kind of film I will see again.I think this film has a great chance come Oscar time for the Art Direction award.\"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\" is in every way just as fun to watch tecnically and emotionally.\n",

Actually, I kind of grew up with Hp movies. Watching the little actors in the movie grow up, I am also growing up. Hp was the hardest memory of my childhood. Opened the door to the magical world of children, although it is no longer a surprise for its imagination of the fantasy world. Professor Snape and Quirrell warn our intuition not to think that what you think is what you think; that despite being a child's story, sometimes the intelligence and courage shown is admirable.\n",

            "Rating: , Review: The thing with the film versions of the Potter books is that they are never like the books. Almost every scene is nothing like the words used in the book. For instance, in the end scene in the cavern with the giant mirrorof erised, Voldemort says that there is no evil or good, but power. However, in the book, it is Quirell who says that. The acting is questionable. I could rant on and on about the things i hate, but i might as well say the things that are good about it. I rate it 4/10. For a movie, 8/10. For a harry Potter adaption, 1/10. If you haven't read the novel you won't understand whats going on, but at least this one basically follows the plot line unlike Azkaban. The effects are all right, and the theme is pretty well made.\n",

Whichever way I take, wherever the whim takes me one thing is guaranteed - someone will always be reading a 'Harry Potter' (or Louis De Bernieres, but don't get me started on that 'mandolin' film!).

            "Rating: 1, Review: Many viewers of this film applaud its faithfulness to the book, however they miss that while the film includes much of the book in it (more than is necessary in fact), it lacks the central story.  That is:  the story of a young boy who has suddenly had his wildest dream come true, and who now must deal with his newfound celebrity, his amazing magical heritage, and most of all, day to day life at Hogwarts with his friends (and enemies).  The movie is more preoccupied with populating Hogwarts with ghosts and moving staircases than it is with characters of any depth.  Everyone from the book, Harry included, suffers from a serious lack of on-screen development, and as a consequence the story lurches  ponderously from event to event without the throughline that stong character development would bring.  I, for one, am not easily impressed by effects, no matter how impressive, especially when they are a duplicitous substitute for the real strength of a story such as this:  character.\n",
            "Rating: 7, Review: The very beginning of a classic film franchise that many people (including me) call a big part of their childhood. When I was a kid, I loved this movie and watched it over and over again. I probably know all the lines in the movie. Then, when I was 14, I watched it again and this time, after reading the book (which is awesome, by the way) and while I enjoyed it as always because all the beautiful memories I get, I found some flaws. Most of them are about differences from the book but we can all say this part is one of the most faithful ones to the book. I will not say much about child actors considering that they were still unexperienced.Looking at them, I must say Emma Watson did the best job as Hermione Granger and Tom Felton was also really good as Draco Malfoy and he just makes you want to punch him in the face which is a good thing looking at his character. Now about adult actors. I think Maggie Smith did the best job as Harry's strict but awesome professor McGonagall. And I'll have to mention Alan Rickman that was really intimidating as professor Snape. I will not mention cast anymore because in my opinion everyone did good. Effects were fine for early 2000s but it doesn't look so good today. But there are some scenes that are still as thrilling as in 2001. But the most brilliant thing in this film is John Williams' beautiful score which totally brings me back to childhood and makes everything more magical. So, when you put everything together, it's a really entertaining fantasy every family should watch and the start of a great adventure.\n",

            "Rating: , Review: A truly engaging film that does applause the achievements of J.K. Rowlings! The storyline is phenomenally creative, yet simple enough to present a lesson of friendship, bravery and love. Truly a lovely and enchanting tale that focuses on good against evil, but without the usual condescending hoopla!   Unique in every aspect that will touch any child's imagination, bewildering them with a touch of Tom Brown School Days, Oliver Twist; and even Christmas Carol.  What makes a better story for children than a tale about an abused young orphan who gradually finds out that he has a lot to offer to his precious world?  Sure, this movie may not have the jaw-dropping appeal, craved by some.  But the GCI effects play well to pump up great charm, mystery, and bountiful of fun.  Watching the Quidditch match and the host of owls sweeping through the dining room is already worth the price of the tix!  The interior of Hogwart School is so unbelievably extravagant, from the dining room to the staircase and then to the common room.  I was simply mesmerized.  And Daniel Radcliffe is a welcomed Harry Potter. This young actor speaks with his eyes, and not with his gestures, and I love the way the camera focuses on his expressive eyes. He has the image of the sort of kid we would love to have in our home and school!   So idealistically pure, gentle and special even in mischief!  My only wish is to see him putting out more gusto with his humor and defiance as the book's Harry.  And the overall cast of actors?  Very delightful, and so true to the book characters!  Little Ron Weasley's performance is tops piping out cool and unexpected humor during the most insignificant times.  And Alan Rickman as Professor Snape: this guy actually sends chills down my spine!  Robbie Coltrane as Hagrid awesome: better than my image of the book character. And Maggie Smith's Professor McGonagall strict, yet with a heart of gold! Yep, lots of actors in an amazing line-up of extraordinary portraitures! Thumbs up to Chris Columbus he certainly has the knack to grip even a six-year old child's attention.  Sure, there are scary parts, but created with taste for the kids in mind.  It's a fast paced movie that has certainly succeeded in bringing the wonderful world of Harry Potter to the silver screen!  Definitely a must-see movie for every child between the ages of six to fourteen, and for anyone longing for some magical moments in his/her life!\n",

I guess it was never meant for those who are into movies about 12-year olds who have magical powers.  Too bad those powers couldn't save this movie from being horrible.  I don't know how this film could have pulled in as much money and critical acclaim as it did.  Maybe it was witchcraft then but it didn't get me to waste my money on going to see it at the theater or rent it on video.  If this movie reaches classic status like \"Titanic\" or \"The Graduate\", I will be extremely horrified.  I give this movie 3 out of 10.\n",

All of the Harry Potter films are 11/10 for me but i have watched this the most because as a kid i use to watch this all the time at Christmas. I now have the boxset on blu ray even though i had the dvds anyway i just wanted them all in one box andcon blu ray and im gonna binge watch them and it just makes me smile everytime beautiful films\n",
            "Rating: 6, Review: Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) lives with his aunt, uncle, and cousin Dudley AKA the Dursleys. His parents were both killed in a car crash when he was very young and he has always been quite strange ever since. Lately, he has been feeling a little stranger than usual. His cousin Dudley has been attacked by a snake when Harry wanted to hurt him and mysterious letters for Harry have been showing up that The Dursleys have UN-mistakenly been trying to hide form him. Harry soon finds out the reason for all of these incidents: He is a wizard. Not only that, he also finds out that he will be attending Hogwarts (Wizarding school for Wizards and Witches) and that his parents were murdered by the most evil of all wizards, Voldemort, who was mysteriously destroyed by Harry.\n",
            "Rating: 9, Review: Harry Potter And the Sorcerer's Stone is a delight.  When a strange visitor shows up on Harry Potter's  eleventh, birthday, he learns that he is a wizard and that there's a place waiting for him at Hogwarts School of Magic.

He also learns that he is a very special young man indeed while displaying kindness and decency all along the way.\n",
            "Rating: 7, Review: So it's the one that started it all - also known as \"the one you can't really criticise because it started it all\". In other words, it makes me feel awful to have to say something negative about what is a good start to possibly the greatest film franchise of all time. But I want to be objective. So, I'll try to just get the negatives out the way firstly and quickly: the film definitely has not aged well. Its PS2-worthy graphics are sometimes laughable, particularly in the troll and Quidditch sequences. In addition, the film sometimes struggles to cram everything into the short space it has - for example, that the first act with the Dursleys is so short is both a curse and a blessing: we don't get to experience the nitty-gritty early years of abuse suffered by Harry that is so well documented in the books - but on the other hand, it just means we get to the magic of Hogwarts so much faster. And finally, on a negative point, its decidedly light and almost twee tone makes it very much child-friendly, but may cause the adults to lose interest now and then. I'm sorry, but these things had to be said.\n",
            "Rating: 9, Review: I just loved every second of it. Sure some of the effects are dated, some of the child acting is a bit weak and the film is filled to the brim with cliches story wise, but I still loved this. The world-building is phenomenal, and I love getting to see this world alongside Harry. It makes him a lot more relatable character. Speaking of the characters, this must have the best set of characters. Ron, Hermione, Draco, Hagrid, Dumbledore - it must be illegal to have so many iconic characters in one film. But the clear standout is Alan Rickman's phenomenal take on Snape. His performance is undoubtedly fantastic, but it reaches a whole other level when you know the outcome of his character. The twist is honestly pretty good here - let's just say 8 year old me was very shocked when Quirrell was revealed. Some of the effects are dated, but the action on the whole is really well shot and perfectly captures the whimsy of this world. The production design is immaculate, and I haven't even mentioned the magnificent score from John Williams, which might just be one of my all time favourites. Overall, my love for this film and this franchise will never decrease over time. Looking back on it it probably isn't the most well made franchise of all time, but this franchise is still just a blast to revisit for me, and I would strongly, strongly recommend it.\n",

            "Rating: 8, Review: The Harry Potter story is brought from the books to the big screen. Never having read the books, I have to rely on anecdotal evidence that the movie stayed pretty true to the stories. I first saw the movie with my family, who've all read the books. But my youngest sister, Kelly, is the biggest fan. After the movie she was telling me all the things that were different or left out. I jokingly asked her, \"So, you didn't like the movie?\"...to which she replied that it was her favorite movie of all-time. That alone, tells me that the movie succeeded. I enjoyed the movie myself and think it's a fun fantasy story that's good for the whole family. The director, Chris Columbus, did a nice job and the actors, especially the kids, were great. Harry Potter is a feast for the eyes and obviously a lot of thought went into the detail. It's heartwarming for me to see this kind of movie made...Something healthy that kids of all ages can be excited about. As a side note, I am especially happy with the books being so popular. It seems like I hardly talk to a kid who hasn't read the books. That says a lot.\n",

This movie is a pretty good start to a series I'm getting sucked in to.  It's perfect for kids, a new classic story for them to enjoy and even learn from.  I liked it because of it's  imagination and originality.  Worth a watch. B+, 8/10\n",

            "Rating: 8, Review: This movie outright bored me. It's a story about a child in sorcery school, but it was filled with the same amount of shenanigans as any other Saved by the Bell episode. The magic he used came with alright and passable special effects, and some of the ideas that the script played around with were interesting such as Quidditch but even then, the execution of the scenes was patchy and confusing. I think it was made for those who had read the books, which are lengthy children's books I wouldn't waste my time with, personally. The actors are alright, but as children they have the capacity to overact way too much. Overall, I didn't really enjoy the series as a whole, at all.\n",

            "Rating: 9, Review: I am willing to aware that this film isn't perfect by any means. Whether it's the off-putting early-2000s CGI or the corny lines prevalent throughout the movie, this movie still has a lot going for it. The casting of this movie is unmatchable and this movie inarguably single-handedly started an entire franchise of billion dollar movies. If this movie would have failed, Harry Potter would have been just another movie studio trying (and failing) to start a successful movie franchise. Harry Potter easily could have ended up like Percy Jackson, Eragon, or The Dark Tower. Overall, this movie is a perfect example of how to successfully adapt a book to a film.\n",
            "Rating: 5, Review: My summary might be a little harsh on what is, after all, a highly entertaining children's movie that's grossed hundreds of millions of dollars and, undoubtedly, still delights children that didn't exist in 2001 through DVD and Blu-Ray. But I stand by my statement - I liked it when I was 9, and I liked it last night, but 'Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone' is paralyzed by its fear of alarming any part of its audience.\n",

            "Rating: 2, Review: What i really do not get is why so many people like this film? Having read the book first i truly fund it awful. I completely understand that bits have to be cut for time but why add in scenes that add nothing (why was there no peeves?). Also Daniel Radcliffes acting is just awful. The scene where he is told that he is a wizard makes me want to cry. Also the character of run could have had some more insightful lines than \"bloody hell\". I really was expecting this to be great knowing how good the book was but the film let me underwhlemed. Some character also completely miss the mark. Draco malfoy is way over done, instead of being snidely nasty but in this comes across as pantomime bad. The only upshot of the film is Alan Rickman's Snape is spot on, Robbie coltrane just about makes a reasonable Hagrid but Emma Watson's Hermione is surprisingly good and upstages the other two so much that it makes some timid scenes almost seem watchable.\n",

Daniel Radcliffe does an excellent job playing our young wizard-to-be and the rest of the cast are just amazing.

The acting was economy class at best and the plot stank worse than a  moldy anchovie sandwich. The only good thing to come out of the movie  is the undeniable talent of Robbie Coltrane. To bad the man wasted his  talents on this piece of trash.  Chris Columbus just can't direct and newcomer Daniel Radcliffe can't  act. The special effects were actually pretty decent for the film.  I would give this movie 0/10 but there is no zero on the voting so I  had to give it a one.\n",

            "Rating: 4, Review: This movie was lacking something. If I think hard enough, I bet I'll remember... Oh, yes, it's lacking exactly what its book counterpart had. Imagination. The book was really good; however, the movie... well, you can see that I gave it a 4. The movie's climax was awful. It was almost as if J. K. Rowling was trying to make this movie into a big mystery rather than an adventure. It was some mystery in the book--but not as much as in the movie. The climax in the book was built solidly on evidence and perfectly fitting pieces. However, the movie had cut-off puzzle pieces that were thrown together in the end and somehow expected to be understood. I would also expect better from John Williams (the guy who composed music for Star Wars, Indiana Jones, Jurassic Park, etc.). I hate to say it, but this music was awful. There was only one spot in which the music fit into the movie and sounded good, and it was toward the end of the movie. John Williams tried too hard to make it sound \"magical\", I think. The movie follows as closely as it can to the book, but I wouldn't really suggest seeing this in the theater unless you're a true die hard Harry Potter fan.\n",

            "Rating: 9, Review: Harry Potter has no doubt, played a role in Pop Culture especially for books and movies. I find it very hard to believe as I'm sure most of you also find it hard to believe that this first movie came out almost 14-years ago. Where has all the time gone? I guess we're done with Harry Potter books since 2007, and Harry Potter movies since 2011. Harry Potter doesn't seem so much a part of Pop Culture anymore. I'd say the movies in Pop Culture now, are Jurassic World, Hunger Games, and Frozen. People remember Harry Potter, but I don't see that much Harry Potter franchise or people talking about it so much anymore. You will occasionally find the Harry Potter films on TV, like ABC Family where they occasionally have Harry Potter marathons.\n",

There is so much creativity, so much atmosphere, so beautiful music in it - you simply have to love it. My god, if I would have still been a child when this movie was released, I probably would have become the biggest fan, buying action figures and the books. Sadly I am a bit too old for the movie, so the movie can't work to his full capability. But even as an adult, you will be sucked up by the atmosphere. It'll make you remember how it was to be a child.\n",

            "Rating: , Review: It is a poorer world without books. When I went to see 'HPATPS' none 0f my family had read more than a few pages of any of JK Rowling's books. I had tried in vain to persuade my two children to become interested in reading. So, I thought, the film may do the trick, and it may just have done that. They are actually threatening to READ it now. Phew! I may even have a go myself. I suspected that the four of us were in a minority in the cinema, not knowing hardly anything about the story. The hype suggested that those 'not in the know' would struggle to follow the opening 30 minutes. I have to report that this warning was superfluos as we all seemed to know exactly what was happening! The money was obviously well spent, and, although I am not a lover of computer effects, they were handled sensitively and sensibly.Dare I suggest that the story did seem to slightly drag in the middle somewhere, but it was always entertaining, because of the fact that everything was wonderful to look at. The fine cast were great, although I kept expecting Alan Rickman to 'let rip', until the end, when I realised why he hadn't! It is the three children, however, who outshone Britain's Best. All 3 are magnificent in their roles, especially Emma Watson, who stole the film for me. My thanks to the director, who, if this film does prompt my children to read, will have, like his namesake, have proved that the world really is round, and not square. Another good thing to come from this film is that the '12' certificate is completely unnecessary. If Harry Potter gets a 'PG' then I can't think of another '12' film I've seen which does not deserve likewise. This was scary at times. Good for the censors, but they really should assess all films consistently.\n",

Rowling series, this has been an arduous wait as they have anticipated their inner most imaginative thoughts of these immortal characters be projected onto the screen in a manner befitting of Hollywood fashion. Warner Brothers, the Studio that released the film knew that that they had their hands on a very bankable box office franchise from the very beginning. Yet, the only way to success would be to efficiently and creatively relay all the character development, plot and imagination that was conveyed from the books.\n",

This movie was 90 percent special effects. It was also way too long and could have been shortened by 25 minutes. I hope Chamber of Secrets is not as long as this one.

            "Rating: 10, Review: Like many people who had read the book before seeing the film I wasn't disappointed. A lot of the film was better than my visualisations when reading the book and the special effects are incredible. The casting is very good. It's a real shame that Richard Harris died. He was great as Dumbledore. Although Maggie Smith as Professor McGonagall sometimes seems like Jean Brodie in a pointy hat (you wonder at what point she's going to say \"Gryffindor are the creme a la creme\") I still wouldn't have cast anyone else in the role. She's spot on. The character of Hagrid could have been written for Robbie Coltrane.Some scenes might be a bit intense for younger children but there's plenty in it to appeal to children of all ages and adults too. It is a fantasy story but there are plenty of things in it kids will identify with. Every school has a precocious poshly named girl like Hermione Grainger and a know-it-all who grasses on his mates like Draco Malfoy. Harry Potter appeals to the universal imagination and touches a nerve with a lot of people. I think it is a bit paranoid to say that it makes children interested in the occult and black magic as it is pure fantasy. I think it is more likely to make kids want to run at the brick pillars between platforms 9 and 10 at King's Cross Station in the hope that they'll go through the wall and they'll be able to board the Hogwarts Express!\n",

I'm one to say this movie equals up to the standards of the book (written by JK Rolling), and accurately portraits some of the scenes that were found within the book. The acting is just average, there is certainly no stand-put performances, but I guess its the \"cool\" effects and \"great ending\" that gave Harry Potter so much publicity and attention. This lives on as one of my favourite fantasy tales. A excellent movie, with wicked characters, some humor, and a fantastic ending.\n",

I have ignored other people's (usually adults) recommendations of it and have no kids to use an excuse to see it and being a male adult in his late twenties i thought i would hate this movie! BUT i watched it and was quite bewildered at how much i enjoyed it. Richard Harris and Robbie Coltrane are of course the best actors in it and the children's acting is ok even though Daniel Radcliffe's acting is unconvincing at times with his words. But i did feel like a kid again while watching it and i can see how easy it could be to get immersed in such a world! Was a little disappointed that Alan Rickman didn't get more scene's as he's always awesome to watch no matter what film he's in. On the whole Harry Potter is for anyone who likes fantasy even though i have to admit it did seem a little too sickly sweet at times. I Like it but it doesn't make me want to read the books though :P 8/10 Oh yeah i watched the second film and Harry and the gang jump to the wrong conclusions about who the culprit is once again! You would have thought they would have learned from this one. DUH!\n",

It is a testament to the power of storytelling and the magic that can be found within the pages of a book. Whether you're a longtime fan or a newcomer to the Wizarding World, this enchanting tale will transport you to a place where dreams and magic intertwine, leaving you yearning for the next chapter in Harry's extraordinary journey.\n",
            "Rating: 6, Review: this is the most important question. If you are between 3 and 13 years old you can go and maybe enjoy this movie. Honestly I can't say that this is a bad movie but it could be better. HP is too long and not very fast but is not even too much slow. Scenarios are nice and that's it. Nothing more to say.\n",
            "Rating: 6, Review: This was a fair attempt but more had gone into the effects than character & humour. The best actors were Tom Felton as Draco Malfoy & Robbie Coltrane as Hagrid. They were spot on. Unfortunately my favourite character, Hermione, was not as sympathetic as in the book. Instead I prefered Draco but he didn't get as much screen time as he deserved. The ghosts were under used too & Peeves was absent entirely. Since he and the Weasley twins provide most of the humour there wasn't much to be found. I liked the moving figures in the paintings and the floating candles but again these moments were only fleeting. I didn't like the Quidditch Match but then it wasn't that interesting in the book either. I was relieved the Dursleys were cut short as they are just annoying and hateful. The snake could have been left out though. I'm not too fond of the species so had to close my eyes for a few minutes. There is more fun to be had reading the book. 6/10\n",

            "Rating: 10, Review: My wife and I recently viewed this 2001 blockbuster on its just released DVD format and we were both favorably impressed.  Its length is \"just right\" but some other factors seemed a bit oddly compressed.  For all those who've read the series of books by J.K. Rowling and who are eager for her now overdue next installment, the movie is like an abridgment for the now-defunct \"Reader's Digest Condensed Books.\"  The set-up of Muggles versus Wizards/Witches/Hogwarts blend of ghosts & supernatural-mythological creatures is highly evocatively rendered; the plot is faithfully gleaned from the original material without the subtlety of the book, especially in regard to the school environment.  I felt a bit shortchanged, however, in regard to any real mystery about the Stone itself that serves as Title Object.  According to the movie's action-driven plot, the top secret nature of the item is kind of a \"fraud\" since nothing is very well-disguised anyway.  Overall, this film is a pleasant Hollywood-version of a well-imagined parallel universe scenario.  High ratings for the special effects and engaging musical score.  The DVD is a bit too kid-oriented for my taste and I would have enjoyed some sort of \"Making of\" documentary.\n",
            "Rating: , Review: This movie was ok. I went to see it with my niece who liked it and has read all the books that have come out so far. When i got there, i thought ok, lets get the show on the road and hurry up. I wanted it to go by real fast, because i thought i would not like the movie. But acually it turned out ok. It was no perfect movie. But it was pretty enjoyable. It will make lots of money due to the books and everything else. It will be a childrens classic and just a classic let alone like the star wars thing. I give it 5/10!\n",
            "Rating: 9, Review: Very respectful of Rowling's novel. This movie is pure gold. Sure, the trio gets a bit better at acting over the course of the series, but the greats like Alan Rickman, Richard Harris, and Maggie Smith more than make up for it.\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: It seems that some that had the fortune to read the Harry Potter books before seeing the movie (I am not one of them), did not like the movie much even though they kept to the book very well.\n",
            "Rating: 6, Review: One of the better childrens movies I have seen, especially since I found the books themselves about as deep as a comic book. Indeed one parent commented to me that it took her child more time to watch the film then to read the book. The sparse and simple dialogue of the books translates well into a script but the real strength of this movie is special effects to rival a Spielberg film and three excellent child actors. I could not however recommend to an adult to run out and spend their 12 dollars on this unless they are bringing a child. This is a detuned Indiana Jones for 10 year olds rather than a film like Shrek that works on two levels. Not really suitable for younger children.\n",

            "Rating: 8, Review: So you're tired of all those kids reporting on the disappointment of seeing their imagination violated when transformed on the big screen by techno-geeks. My son refuses to go because he doesn't want to ruin his vision of this modern classic. Good, but since I couldn't get out from under the staircase in Book 1, I really have nothing to lose.\n",
            "Rating: 9, Review: I am more than a little surprised to see critics of Harry Potter grousing about bad chess moves and details from the book being left out. Lighten up. A movie never includes every detail from a book, nor does it get every small matter of opinion (i.e. chess strategy) correct. A movie entertains, and when it comes from a book, it creates a living world that more of less matches the world the reader had imagined. Harry Potter #1 does a very good job of bringing this world to the screen.\n",

            "Rating: 8, Review: The sixth installment in the incredibly popular wizard series carries on the tradition of following the books. The half-blood prince probably won't bring with it the expectations that came with the Philosopher's stone but then it is expected to be lower key as the franchise comes to a closure- there remains just one more book after this (deathly hollows). However, this film is darker in tone and should be headed for more mature territory just like the series.\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: The amount of time that I can get on my hands to read books is very less and hence it was always my last choice to read a Harry Potter book considering that it is meant for the children. No amount of hype about the Harry Potter book could ever drive me to read the book. I always would resort to alternate reading. And then one fine day, I saw this computer game of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. I enjoyed playing it and it was through the game I came to know the story of Harry Potter. I felt that it was so brilliantly done. I began to wonder whether it was the creativity of the game designers that created this world or was it the sheer genius of the author to make us imagine such a world. I decided to find out and finally read the book. And it was then I realized that Rowling had indeed created a whole new world for us and so fresh it was.\n",
            "Rating: 7, Review: I will always think fondly of this movie because it inspired me to pick up the first Harry Potter book and I've been a rabid fan ever since. I'm one of those book before movie people so I had to read the novel in order to go see this movie and I was pleased to see that it was such a faithful adaptation to Rowling's wonderful tale.\n",
            "Rating: 7, Review: Having read the first few Harry Potter books before 2001 and hearing about the hype for the first movie, I was excited. I heard there was going to be an all-British cast (which makes sense, right?) and we'd get to see a live version of one of the defining novels of our generation. From what I remember I went with my family and a family friend to see the movie the day after Christmas and was pleasantly amazed. After the movie was over, I watched the credits and discovered some familiar names (the late Alan Rickman, Sister Act's Maggie Smith, James Bond 007's Robbie Coltrane, and Star Wars' Warwick Davis); others not so familiar (the kids, some of whom had their debut). But it was a good movie and was a party of colors and sights for all to see. This is easily my favorite of all the Harry Potter films. The catalyst of the movie series!\n",

They picked three great kids for the leads, and did a good job with the other roles as well. As far as how the story translated to the big screen, well, obviously, some parts recived more or less attention than in the book, and the same applies to characters. But overall, it was great!\n",
            "Rating: 8, Review: This movie was not what I expected. Even though acting for a kid is quite difficult but I thought the acting was terrible. They left out a whole lot of scenes that were in the book. I know if you put all the parts in the book in the movie, the movie would be very long but I thought they should have put more classes he took in the book because in the movie there was only a few classes they showed he took. The Dursley house was the worst acting of all the movie. Just how they spoke made me go crazy. Although, the movie besides the acting was ok and I'll give the movie 8/10 because I think the acting was worth 2 points. It's a very good movie for kids, even though it's made for kids, but since I read every book, I expected a little more. So overall I thought the movie was ok.\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: The first instalment in the Harry Potter series is fun, charming, and magical. The plot moves along smoothly with a few genuinely surprising twists and turns. The actors are generally quite good. The special effects, while occasionally showing their age, are fantastic. The thing that immediately drew me in, though, was the music score. John Williams really outdid himself here - it gives a mysterious, magical, and charming feel to it. I also really liked the care and attention to detail that went into this movie - the costumes, all the details about Hogwarts, etc. A truly fantastic fantasy film.\n",
            "Rating: 5, Review: I think this was a good adaptation from the original novel and an entertaining movie for Christmas. It must've been a fantastic movie for Potter's fans, since Rowling was very much involved in maintaining originality in the film making. The special effects and casting were good and well polished. The setting and atmosphere were magical too. A highly recommended adventure for the young ones. In terms of target reader/audience, the movie producer and J.K. Rowling have got it right. It was indeed a story that appeals more to the young audience, but rather shallow for mature audiences. I suggest reading The Books of Magic series, courtesy of DC/Vertigo Comics, a brilliant and superior predecessor to Harry Potter, by Neil Gaiman, John Bolton and John Ney Rieber.\n",

            "Rating: 9, Review: This rich adaptation of the first of J.K. Rowling's bestselling novels, about Harry Potter's adventures during his first year at Hogwarts, gets the budding franchise off to one hell of a start and myself finally into the thick of Pottermania after I watched the DVD and raced through all four books last summer. Daniel Radcliffe (Harry), Rupert Grint (Ron Weasley) and Emma Watson (Hermione Granger) become so immersed in their roles, we have to remind ourselves that we're watching actors. The same goes for all the supporting characters, who are too numerous to mention here, because it's impossible to single out only a select few. There's not one bad performance to be seen. Complementing the players are solid direction by Chris Columbus, incredible sets by Stuart Craig and a powerful soundtrack by John Williams. When you think about it, has the man ever really composed a bad score? HP's only flaws are a long introduction and slow second-half pacing. Were it not for the awesome \"Tomb Raider,\" the boy wizard would have conjured up the best movie of 2001. Yes, you read that right.\n",

Why would I wait so long to see this movie and come out disappointed. Well the fact of the matter is, it was way too long for a movie like this. It had lots of talking about non-relative things, and NO action until the end. I was seriously disappointed. Wait until its free at the library. My Take: 5/10 My MPAA rating: PG for violence/peril and mild language.\n",
            "Rating: 6, Review: Probably the greatest waste of talent and money since the Burton/Taylor \"Cleopatra\" of the 1960s. After the initial scenes with Fiona Shaw and Richard Griffiths, the thing is just one interminable stretch of ennui, inter-spersed with special effects which are initially quite good but which, fatally, do nothing to bring the pasty-faced and innocuous \"lead\" character child actors to life, about whose fates and undertakings one becomes progressively LESS interested as the whole things drags itself from one phony set scene to the next until, after two and a half hours, (which seems like months!), the whole thing fades out like a candle finally guttering in its holder. Maggie Smith, Richard Harris, Robbie Coltrane etc. etc. must have sent their agents a Christmas bonus for having secured parts for them in this turkey which demanded of them less engagement than a Roger Moore 007 epic and, even better (!), set them up for numerous sequels until the kids gripped by the books finally add a few years and move onto movies for kids, (and adults!), which, unlike this junk, really DO entertain and amuse, e.g. \"Shrek\", \"Toy Story\", \"Antz\" etc. etc.\n",

            "Rating: 9, Review: Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is an excellent film. The casting was perfect, it's like they knew these kids would evolve into the part, the soundtrack from John Williams is top notch, and it's just a fun film to watch. There are some who argue that by following the book so closely the film becomes a bit stale, but I couldn't think of a better way to start the series. By being so faithful to the book, we're able to learn more about the characters and the magical world around them. There are certain parts that could've been fixed but they aren't major and they don't take away from the overall enjoyability of the movie. If you haven't started the series yet or if you just feel like going back to where it all began, I highly recommend this film. A near perfect start to the epic film series.\n",

            "Rating: , Review: It seems that this movie has won the hearts of people who have read the book, and NOT read it. But I must say that this was way too slimmed down. For example, we see one Quidditch game (if you don't know, I'll explain later) to the books plural number (I wasn't counting the Quidditch games). Also, there was a conversation on Harry at the beginning of the book, and I think it was also between Uncle Vernon (I forget, is that his name?) and some other person that I don't remember the name of. I also remember Dumbledore choking on the ear wax flavored Bertie Botts' Every Flavor Beans (ICK!). The snake at the beginning had more speech... we never see Dudley's gang... the Midnight Duel's gone... Norbert (Hagrid's dragon) flies away, and they don't attempt to sned him to Ron's brother... the list goes on... Why omit so much stuff? My guess is that the filmmakers didn't want to bore the kids with a 3-hour film. However, younger children would be scared away by the scary moments, and I think that the remainder have sat through \"Titanic.\" (Don't ask me why. I hate the movie, and haven't even seen it!)\n",

I watched it after reading the book, and although I must admit that I enjoyed the book more, the movie made a valiant effort to capture the essence of the story and most of its narratives.

I went into this movie thinking, \"It is just a kids movie, so what's the fuss all about?!\"  It wasn't what I expected.  There were lots of kids in the theater, but this is not your everyday kid movie.  This movie was pretty cool and if you don't know anything about Harry Potter, you will.  This is a serious movie (no useless dancing or singing just because they can * cough * disney).  Harry Potter is also long, so make sure you go to the restroom before it starts.\n",

To be fair, its impossible for the movies to weave the same kind of magic as the books. I thought I would be able to appreciate it separate from the books as an adult but oh man was I wrong, still unwatchable. The script is thin and the acting is awful. The only saving graces are Richard Harris as Dumbledore and a marvelous score. Otherwise, this film is decidedly unmagical.\n",
            "Rating: 7, Review: Not having read Harry Potter I thought this was a very ordinary movie. It seems to be a combination of so many other films and books - particularly British children's fiction - that there's nothing outstanding or original about it. Probably the best thing about it is the set and the locations that they found - except Kings Cross station of course! The children are a bit stiff in their acting but it was good to see that it hadn't been made into some awful homogenised Hollywood schmaltz. I am sure it'll earn a billion but only because the books have been so successful.Definitely one for avid fans or those yet to reach puberty.\n",

Harry Potter was directed by Chris Columbus. The day of his 11th birthday, Harry is enrolled at Poudlard magic and witchcraft school. The parents of Harry died when he was a little boy. In my opinion, I like this movie because it is a adventure movie, and I like this movie where there is magic and wizard. I am fan of Harry Potter because he is brave to live without his parents. The universe of the movie is magic. The setting and the customs are well done. If you like magic characters and adventure movie, you should watch Harry Potter.\n",

            "Rating: , Review: I got into Harry Potter before all the hype.  A story about an ordinary boy who discovers he's an extraordinary wizard ...  I gotta get into that!  I decided to read the first book before the movie came out to formulate my own impressions - and I ended up reading all 4! Even though there was more in the book than the movie, most of the characters in the movie were exactly how I pictured them.  Hermione even *sounded* like I pictured her! I can't stand all the religious controversy. There is no evil ulterior motive. Harry and friends are good wizards fighting the evil Voldemort and his nasty cronies. It's about good versus evil and the good coming out on top. It teaches children to be good. When you see children dressed up for parties they're dressed as Harry and friends - not Voldemort! As a white witch myself, I practice magick in my daily life for good, peace, harmony and abundance, and to honour the Earth and the ancient ways.  I never use magick for evil, harm or to manipulate others. Although the magic in Harry Potter is make believe it is encouraging to note that people are realising that good magic is not evil. I have seen the movie and read the books over and over.  There are characters who the children can relate to and characters who the adults can relate to, like Professor Snape.  He is a very deep character who on the surface seems mean, but there's much more to him than that.  Alan Rickman plays Snape perfectly. How many people thought Snape was the evil one after the stone? Even I did at first, but I am rather proud of my deduction when I worked out it wasn't him. It's a pity there are no magical schools like Hogwarts! The Harry Potter series helps people realise that they are special, and believe in themselves and their own special magick even if they feel ordinary.\n",

I'm an avid book reader,so I didn't get round to reading the 'Philosophers Stone' (or 'Sorcerers Stone') till a few moths before the film opened. I loved the book, and was really looking forward to the film. I wasn't disappointed. When the film started, I felt as excited as a little kid (I am in fact 22) and was grinning like a mad woman! This film bought back that kind of childish excitment I used to feel when going to see a Disney movie on the cinema. I think we need more films like this. The casting is perfect. Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson are all brilliant. (Ron almost steals the show)and all the grown ups are brilliant too.It's funny,imaginative and exciting. No one should make a fuss about sequences cut from the book, because obviously they  coludn't keep everything. Imagine how long 'Gone With The Wind' would have been if they'd kept everything in!\n",

            "Rating: 8, Review: I haven't read the books yet, I wanted to see at least one of the films first. My opinion is based only on the film. The cast and crew did a beautiful job in creating a truly magical world. I tend to love movies that paint a picture on a grand scale, and this film truly did just that. The sets were remarkably done and the performances came across on genuine and believable. Regardless of any controversy surrounding the book or film, I would recommend it to anyone. It's a great fantasy/adventure.\n",

            "Rating: 8, Review: I saw this movie and I was very much impressed. Chris Columbus had really captured the magic with his amazing creativity. He takes us to a wonderful journey through the magical community. The cast was perfect. The Music was really awesome. The theme song really had the magic in it. Awesome visual effects. The movie was beautifully taken. It had all the elements, the humor, the happiness, the darkness, the sadness and the magic. The movie is as good as the book. My favorite part is the chess under the trapdoor.\n",

            "Rating: 2, Review: This film was just plain poorly made, there is no trying to deny that. It was based on a 300 page (fairly easy to adapt) world record breaking novel that in the opinion of many is one of the best books ever written. When it was announced that director Chris Columbus would helm the project, many moaned and groaned, his previous works have lacked in... erm... entertainment. Steve Kloves was assigned to adapt, Kloves is not as seasoned a man as several other talented screenwriters. So we now have a mediocre director and screenwriter assigned to one of the potentially greatest films of all time. It was expected that the actors who would eventually play the trio would have to be 'green' (unexperienced) because veteran child actors are often not right for franchise roles. So a new ensemble, a poor director, and a mediocre screenwriter. But it could still have come out good right?... WRONG! Chris Columbus' direction was absolutely appalling! His incoherent transitions, unchanging camera angles, lack of any use of dolly shots, over-use of tracking shots, monotonous lighting, and complete ignorance to inform his actors how to actually act, immediately contributed to the collapse of this picture. Kloves' writing didn't contribute any quality to the abysmal film either. The novel was an epic: written as an epic, described as an epic, and sold as an epic. So why was the script written like a quirky independent film? Furthermore the CGI in this film (despite Columbus' excuses of time restrictions) INEXCUSABLE! You do not have ghosts float in 2D patterns as though designed on Apple iMovie when you have a budget exceeds 100 Million dollars! Now: The Ensemble. Too many reviews have been published tearing apart the acting of the three actors portraying the most well known characters in history. So I won't... JUST KIDDING! The acting was and remains now, encased in DVD releases, some of the worst in cinema history. \"You mean? That thing was Voldemort?\" was meant to be spoken in a spine-chilling and dragged-out way that made the audience cringe in terrifying realization, and was instead spoken as though Harry Potter had stumbled upon a surprise party. Daniel Radcliffe and Emma Watson deliver some of the MOST irritatingly bad lines ever spoken, it's rather easy to simply learn to not over-act, to not under-act, to just act! Espesially in a role so perfectly described in books. Rupert Grint was tolerable. The movie was an enormous insult to the well-written book of the same name and despite the hype surrounding the apparent attraction ten year old girls have to Daniel Radcliffe (whose normal weight does not fit the skinny persona described in the book) and the \"amazing\" (gag) special effect, most critics and fans alike cannot bare to even watch the film a first or for those unfortunate ones like myself a second time. I only wonder if, somehow seeing how bad the movie adaptation would be, J.K. Rowling would have instead named the Centaur Firenze: Torgo.\n",
            "Rating: 7, Review: Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone had a lot to live up to as a book-to-film adaptation. For-the-most-part, the movie delivers as being entertaining, but any fans wanting more than a passing movie might be disappointed.\n",

Christopher Lee looks cool and especially the army shot presumably of clones on the ramp, as well as the one where he is riding the speeder on Tatooine, that was cool as well, as for the bounty hunter shots, it was well worth 13.50. I suppose they added the bonus movie 'Harry Potter and the Cinematographer's Stone' to satisfy the non Star Wars fans, I didn't mind that too much really though.\n",

I have never read any of the books and i only heard about harry potter when it came out at the cinema but i never did went but just watched it on DVD and its a really good film enjoyed alot. Great fantasy little bit better then lord of the rings and its really good to see full cast of fine BRITISH actors and not having to put up with american accent like in spider-man that was also RUBBISH. Little bit disappointed that not seeing any BRITISH FLAGS in the film like the american do glot there flag around in films. Loved the quiddish match its kinda like a football game but diffrent anyway this is an excellent film with good special effects.\n",
            "Rating: 8, Review: The first harry potter film was undoubtedly the most emotional for me, as we followed a few of the minor protagonists and enjoyed the charm of hogwarts. Whether it's the giant hagrid or the treasure chest of diagon alley, whether it's the sharp-tonned sorting hat or the wall painting that talks to you at the door, it's all fascinating.\n",
            "To tell you the truth, the first book was very good in both content and pace, and in just two hours, it not only introduced us to the world, but also told us the story of the philosopher's stone very clearly.

            "Rating: 7, Review: I liked the movie, and though it did a pretty good job of presenting a \"Cliff's Notes\" version of the book.  (Well, not really.  Real Cliff's Notes typically include analysis along with the synopsis that students sometimes use to avoid reading the whole book.)  For someone who has read the book, the movie is somewhat superfluous, although it is a decent effects showcase. For someone who hasn't read the book, it's a good shortcut to the story, although it misses a lot of the verbal cleverness of the book.\n",

The very fact that this movie had a bigger take than The Phantom Menace made me believe this was going to be equally as entertaining, but it wasn't.  I had a hard time comparing it to E.T. because to me it seemed more like Disney than Steven Spielberg for the entertainment value.  Overall, I would recommend that you see a matinee showing rather than pay full price. I give it a 5 out of 10.\n",
            "Rating: , Review: This review is mainly intended for Christian parents who are unsure whether they should let their kids go and see this film. There are a number of stories circulating in the Christian community -- almost none of them good -- about Harry Potter books and their author, J.K. Rowling. Many of these stories are unsubstantiated and at least one is outright falsehood (see www.ship-of-fools.com/Myths/index.html) ... but any book or movie that seems to glorify witchcraft and wizardry is bound to cause legitimate concerns among Christian parents. This review concentrates on the movie itself.\n",
            "Rating: , Review: First of all, I've read the first two Potter books and found them pleasant and clever, but hardly brilliant. They certainly don't measure up to classics like the Narnia cycle, Tolkien's books, or Madeleine L'Engle's either (A Wrinkle in Time, for instance.) Though undoubtedly clever, much of the author's cleverness is of a literary nature, which made me skeptical about how it would fare as a film. My skepticism turns out to have been well-founded. The movie is certainly faithful to the book, perhaps too much so. It could have been pared by a half hour or so and been the better for it. Chris Columbus's overuse of close-up reaction shots--Harry grinning, Harry and his friends looking at something in pop-eyed awe, Harry grinning yet again--to drive home how a scene was supposed to make the viewer feel--drove me a little mad toward the end. Subtle, this director ain't. There is, to be sure, excellent work by some fine veteran actors, such as Richard Harris, John Hurt, Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman, and Robbie Coltrane. But, at the risk of being labeled a curmudgeon, I found the kids, though cute as buttons, were simply not up to their roles. Again, Columbus's constant closeups didn't serve the young actors well, and it may be regarded as unfair of me to expect kids to have the kind of inner resources to develop fully-fleshed performances. But they are expected to carry this film to a very large extent, and--well--they couldn't quite do so. There's also something a little repellent about the book and the film with respect to the portrayal of Muggles--non-initiates to the world of witchcraft--as being (at least implicitly) invariably stupid, crass, and cruel. I also question the propriety of equating obesity with meanness and greed---even worse in the book than the movie. Kids with a weight problem must have some difficulty dealing with this aspect of the world of Harry Potter. Well, my money has already gone into the record-breaking box office gross that this juggernaut is piling up. And that, after all, is the point. Maybe the next film in the series will be better; the young actors will be a year older and the second book is a little more substantial than the first. But I do wish they'd bring in a different director. Under the circumstances, there's not a hope of that. Bah, humbug.\n",
            "Rating: 7, Review: HP is very enjoyable. It has several features that make it a good film; the story- which is about magic, evil and friendship. This story works really well- I had read the book before watching it, and thought that it was a very good adaptation.\n",

            "Rating: 8, Review: Obviously there was an enormous amount of pressure, expectation, and anticipation for this movie and I, for one, was not too disappointed. Ok, it was not a 10, but at least it was fairly faithful to the book. I think its failure may, in some respects, have been that it was too faithful to the book. A film will never quite be able to match the imaginations of millions of children. My wife critised the acting of the children but it was a children's fantasy movie for goodness sake - chronic overacting was required input. I think that the movie is running at almost exactly the right vote. As my brother remarked, 'not so much a 10 on any one thing but a solid 8 all around'.\n",
            "Rating: 9, Review: Harry Potter is a movie that has been read by many children and for many of them seeing the film is giving them the chance to see something that they have an image of because of the book. This doesn't mean that children will hate this film as it's brilliant. The acting is quite good and the whole thing has been made superbly, but what will adults see in the film? They will see a children's film and they will enjoy it as it's enjoyable for anyone, but they won't gloat and shine as much as children and may find that they really only want to see it once. Whatever age you are, this is a great film and will probably become a classic in the Family genre, but there's the fact that it's really just a remake of a book which gives you the feeling that your just watching another film that shows a lot of special effects and not any plot. This is wrong as there is a plot but you just get that feeling.4 out of 5.\n",

            "Rating: 9, Review: there is nothing wrong with this splendid and entertaining adaption of JK Rowling's first book of the young wizard. Although my mum, who has read the book, said that they did miss some scenes from the book, as a movie-goer I enjoyed it! This is probably one of the best children's films since Babe, so only a 6 years difference. So is it good? Well, it is over-rated but performances from Robbie Coltrane and even John Cleese, his first children's film role since The Wind in the Willows, makes the film enjoyable for me. And of course, Harry Potter himself, Daniel Raddcliffe, should become the next Macaulay Culkin as he is truly brilliant in his role. So with some new and some old stars in this magnificent film, this was truly a good rival for The Lord of the Rings:The Fellowship of the Ring!\n",

            "Rating: 7, Review: Its not at all appropriate to regard it as a movie meant for kids. After watching you will realize that the world of fantasy and magic is totally enjoying. I haven't read book and so I won't be talking in comparison but the movie is a well made start for the series. The direction is good and screenplay is very interesting. It totally feels that we have entered in another world. The younger cast has done really good and are totally characteristic in their role. Its not surprising that you may start believing in magic as the magical experience of the movie is so lively. I must say this is one of the best fantasy concept and its worth watching.\n",

            "Rating: 9, Review: The only regret I have about HARRY POTTER AND THE PHILOSOPHER'S STONE is that I'm not ten years old anymore.  Alas, I'm double that age (still young, obviously!!), and only discovered the wonder of Harry Potter, Hogwarts and Quidditch eighteen months ago.  Of course, I've since purchased all four novels and two supplementaries (FANTASTIC CREATURES and QUIDDITCH), and have just seen the film, which opened five days ago here.  Yes, I suppose we had our own books and films when we were children (including FINDERS KEEPERS, TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES, BATMAN, THE WITCHES), but nothing which united (nearly) everyone, and appealed to parents and older children as much as HARRY POTTER.  The simplicity of the concept is, of course, the key: it's a fairly formulaic plot, with semi-predictable twists (of course, I'm speaking more from an adult point of view here) and the subject matter is something which will continue to fascinate children for generations to come - magic. The film is, in my opinion, the best possible outcome of attempting to adapt the novel: the Quidditch game is spot-on, the child actors are well-cast (even if they do try to overact in places, but one has to expect this), the magic of Hogwarts Castle and Hogwarts Express and the invisibility cloak is definitely there.  Some have accused it of dragging in the middle - I must say I was expecting this, being a part-Hollywood production and nearly 150 minutes long, but I never experienced it: I was obviously too preoccupied with the wonder and magic of it all.  I couldn't help thinking how I would have reacted to such a film ten years ago: I would have surely been in heaven.  The real magic of the story is, of course, Rowling's promotion of \"dorky\" behaviour, which has been victimised in the last fifteen years from Americanised \"satirical\" TV series (THE SIMPSONS, SOUTH PARK, etc...) and general irresponsibility by marketers aiming their products at children. For example, children as young as seven and eight are worrying about \"image\" - boys must have short spikey blonde-tipped hair like the boy-bands, and girls must dress like Brittney: they are being forced to grow up far too quickly, and are exposed to images etc which have detracted from traditional children's stories...until now.  Ten-year-olds don't listen to Peter Coombe anymore, because there's no such performer out there: youngsters still have The Wiggles, and Hi-Five is doing its best, but acts like Brittney Spears & Co. have broken into this (very lucrative) age bracket - kids must now act like teenagers, another culture which didn't exist pre-rock'n'roll.  But with texts like HARRY POTTER, MONSTERS INC, A SERIES OF UNFORTUNATE EVENTS, etc..., kids can be kids again: it's becoming accepted once more.  Hell, HARRY POTTER promotes reading, playing chess, intelligence, initiative - and glasses (!!), five things which have certainly been \"outlawed\" in the past decade by THE SIMPSONS and SOUTH PARK-style shows.

It is inevitably going to be exposition-heavy and heavy-handed in its treatment of the characters, and the plot is always going to be as literally adapted as possible. Christopher Columbus, while probably not the best director for this job, nevertheless managed to pull it off without doing a terrible job. Had this been judged as any other Potter film, however, it would probably have received a 4/10 as it was possibly one of the worst in comparison to the others.\n",

I think the few minor changes were well done (the snake is from Brazil in the book and Burma in the film) and the story was related well.  I loved the Quidich match, forgot that it is imaginary half way through. I thought the casting was stupendos.  The actors were well chosen and knew their characters very well.

Thanks to the creative genius of J. K. Rowling, the judicious use of some excellent British actors, and an enormous budget, this is a film that treats its young viewers with respect.  Instead of the usual schmaltzy children's fare, Harry Potter (notwithstanding a few minor aberrations) thankfully doesn't descend into the saccharine.  On the contrary, it is a highly original and very entertaining trip into the hitherto infrequently visited realm of magic.      \n",

Ironically, you may very well enjoy it more if you've never read J.K Rowling's world famous novel, as I and some others who've seen it found it hard to get into the film, as we were watching it with half an eye for how accurately it fitted our visions rather than enjoying it purely for itself. \n",

I remember when it came out, I had a huge fit because I didn't see it on opening day. It was worse for Chamber of Secrets, though. I watched it again, and I noticed it went by much faster than I remembered, but I still think that this movie is a masterpiece. I think that it was cool that they got a movie release so soon after the original novel. I will always love this movie, no matter how flawed it is, although there isn't that many.

Oddly enough, if you DID read the book before you enjoy the movie better... opposit to what happens usually. This because the only possible flaw i can spot is - the plot is maybe a bit hurried. But what do i care, i DID read the book first! So i passed 150 minutes of total, relaxing visual banquet. Exactly how i depicted it in my fantasy, or maybe even better.\n",
            "Rating: , Review: This is a really poor adaptation of the book. Chris Columbus should go back to the Home Alone series.\n",
            "Rating: 5, Review: When I obtained pre booked tickets for the long awaited 'Harry Potter and the Sorcerors Stone (Philosiphers Stone) I was very pleased with myself and went into the packed cinema to get a good seat. When the film started however, I noticed the massive chunks of the book just dissapearing in the wave of a wand. Director Chris Colombus is not too good at this type of film and lets us down with his nasty angles and overuse of zoom. The child acting is terrible at best, though Rupert Grint plays a satisfactory part as Ron Weasley, Harry's mate. Steve Kloves has completely destroyed a fantastic book with this screenplay, though, if you ignore the amazing book, you may enjoy this film.\n",
            "Rating: 8, Review: Before this film came out I was expecting a pile of puke but was pleasantly surprised. This film is very entertaining, what with its all star cast that includes, among others, Alan Rickman, Richard Griffiths (in top form) and even John Cleese. But there is one thing which drives me nuts and that is the actors who play Hermione and Harry. They are anoying and somewhat bad actors (not that I'm saying I could do better, but I probably could. Atleast I would be funny). But the one out of the three main characters who impressed me the most was Rupert Grint as Ron Weasley, and another thing that drives me mad is the way that everyone criticises his acting. Screw them, you kick-ass Rupert! Anyway this film is really worth seeing, especially if you liked the book (have you heard of it?) Enjoy it!\n",
            "Rating: 6, Review: I've read all the Harry Potter books with my daughter. They're best for ages 8 to 10. They're fun but not great. This movie is not as much fun. People who think it keeps to the book should re-read the book.\n",
            "Rating: , Review: Well, sooner or later you goodlies here at the Internet Movie Database would have to hear from us at Hogwarts. That said, let me thank the Muggles of 1492 Pictures and Heyday Films, whose combined talents were instrumental in making our film possible.   Where, I wonder, should I begin? Perhaps we should give a proper thumbs-up to Steve Kloves for crafting such a magnificent screenplay. I only hope that the goodlies at Don Shay and Jody Duncan's Cinefex Magazine will put together an official making-of-the-film book, so that everyone can remember the adventure we shared with our Master Potter. Richard Harris does such a tremendous job bringing me .... well, to life --- so much so, in fact, that I doubt I will ever be seen in the same light again. I will, however, tell you that, during the Los Angeles World Premiere of the film, an Associated Press photographer --- one with a very keen eye, I might add! --- caught yours truly shaking hands with David Hasselhoff! (Would that I could have done a guest shot on Baywatch! [Heh-heh!] It might have been fun teaching Mitch Buchanan and company a few lessons in water safety --- Hogwarts style!)\n",

            "Rating: 9, Review: I'm glad I read (and enjoyed) the book before seeing this movie, because I think it improved the overall experience. HARRY POTTER AND THE SORCERER'S STONE is fun for all ages with outstanding acting from just about everyone involved, likeable characters, beautiful scenery, impressive special effects, funny jokes and good drama. The THE WIZARD OF OZ (9/10) of this generation. Highly recommended.\n",

            "Rating: 8, Review: \"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\" marked the first time I ever counted down the days to a film's release. I had read the first four books, loved every single one of them, and I was eagerly anticipating seeing one of my favorite world's come to life on the big screen. I was not disappointed. It remains, to date, one of the best cinema going experiences of my life.\n",

            "Rating: 10, Review: At the time of this films relase it was rather fashionable to be synical about the whole Potter phenomenom..'Its a load of crap for kids' was the usual comment. I was similarly minded about Ms Rowlings creation UNTIL I was talked into going to see this film by the Mrs. From the opening scene the film took me to what it was like to be a kid again, watching the BBC fantasy series I used to love like 'the Box of Delights' and 'the Children of Greene Knowe'. The whole thing gave me a tremededous sense of wonder and excitement and was a PERFECT example of how kids film should be. it also got me to read the books\n",
            "Rating: 9, Review: Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone. An amazing adaption from J.K Rowling's classic novel. Every time I see this work of art, it's a mesmerising experience. \n",
            "Rating: 6, Review: Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone (2001) is the first movie of the Harry Potter franchise, directed by Chris Columbus, who directed two first Home Alone movies. This is one of my favorite fantasy movies. There's so much things to see, a lot more than Lord of the Rings.\n",
            "About the casts, Daniel Radcliffe was chosen to be Harry Potter, the boy who lived, Rupert Grint as Ronald Weasley, Emma Watson as Hermione Granger. I really love these three characters and I also love it when they team up to discover something. I also like Alan Rickman being Severus Snape (one of my favorite characters). His voice was amazing and I couldn't describe it. And there's Tom Felton as Draco Malfoy, one of they characters I hated the most. He's an a-hole, always messed up with Harry Potter and his friends with his dumb friends, Vincent Crabbe and Gregory Goyle. I really hate Malfoy but I don't hate Felton bacause he acted well being one of our most hated characters. One of my favorite characters is Rubeus Hagrid, a lovable giant who always smile when he saw Harry Potter.\n",
            "There's lots of magic in this movie. Everything is creative. And the most creative thing is Hogwarts school of Witchcraft and Wizardry. It had a creative name (with a Hog). The creative things about Hogwarts is they there're four houses and your personality depends on one of them. Quidditch is a really creative sports. Being in a broomstick hitting and catching a Quaffle or using a bat and hit the Bludgers or maybe catching a Snitch is so much fun but also dangerous. The subjects like Herbology are also really creative. Everything in Hogwarts makes me wanted to be a wizard in there. It's such a great school. You can be far away from your parents just like Harry being away from those stupid Dudleys (they're worse than Malfoy). I also loved the CGI, they made everything looked like real magic or maybe a different dimension. The one problem is when they put their camera behind Harry Potter with a red sweater facing Professor Quirrel looked like a video game. I don't know how it happened but it was like a video game from my perspective.\n",
            "The Original Score from John Williams is so iconic. It was perfect for the movie and everytime you come to a Harry Potter Wizarding World, you'll hear the score played and it will bring you to the place itself.\n",
            "The Harry Potter Universe is my favorite world. There's creative magic and J.K Rowling is creative. Harry Potter and the Sorcerer Stone is one of the greatest movies that filled your childhood with dreams and joys. Though it's not my favorite of the franchise but the movie is the greatest introduction to this franchise.\n",
            "Rating: 8, Review: The Harry Potter books are only the single most popular children's stories in existence - most children under the age of thirteen (and a good chunk of adults as well) can recite the books verbatim. Drawing from fantasy literature and owing quite a debt to earlier writers such as Roald Dahl, J.K. Rowling made her stories about Harry the Wizard into a phenomenon. It's been a merchandising groundswell, a boon to children's literature, and a godsend to parents everywhere.  What could be better than having your child dive into a 300+ page book for hours on end?  Why, making those books into movies, of course.  No pressure.\n",
            "Rating: 4, Review: What is a great story; well-cast; and with rich cinematographic license (a long word to say special effects), is spoiled by the worst editing job of the year. Scenes that go nowhere and mean nothing are interspersed within the movie. And they leave one wondering what the hell the director was doing. The library-research scene with the warm lamp and the bad guys rushing off to locate the intruder is completely left hanging. The scene beneath the trapdoor where the heroes have to win at chess to enter, only to find the bad guy already there without any such challenge. And the fifteen minute Quillage scene which is merely a set-up to a stupid gag (literally) joke. These mistakes, and others, left me bored and bewildered. However if you have a ten year old, or younger, they will probably be more taken with the tricks than with the failings.\n",
            "Rating: , Review: Dear Ms. Rowling:\n",
            "Rating: 4, Review: While the visuals were occasionally pleasing, this is the nicest thing I can manage to say about this terrible movie. I usually try to express my opinions with subtle language, but such expressions fail me when I think back on the 200 minutes of torture I just put myself through.\n",
            "Rating: , Review: If you have read any of the Harry Potter books, I do not suggest this, unless  you like to see big changes. And I mean BIG. There are so many errors in this movie, I cannot possibly list them all. 20 minutes into the movie, he is already on the Hut-on-the-rock. Ginny, for example, in the whole of the movie, 150 minutes, says only two words, \"Good\" and \"luck\". I hope she takes a much bigger role in the next, as she is a big part. If she doesn't, that will be exceedingly unfair to Bonnie Wright. She definetly deserves it...and what about Rik Mayall? He was supposed to have been in the movie, as Peeves...but do we see him? No! And I WAS expecting a little more than a white bald head for Voldemort. He is a demon, not a little bald head. That, really is pathetic. The only reason this movie was halfway decent was that J.K. Rowling worked on the script. If you're lazy, and don't have the \"time\" or \"energy\" to read the book, then I recommend this movie. Unfortunately, there are too many of the kind of people I just mentioned in the world. PLEASE don't take after them and be like that BLOND balloon, Dudley. ((((((((((((((Uncle Vernon's face was purple, Dudley and his mother were blonde, and it mentioned alot about Harry's messy hair. COME ON PEOPLE!))))))))))))))\n",
            "Rating: , Review: First of all I have to say I haven't yet read J K Rowling's books, so I am in the apparently unenlightened position of not feeling it necessary to compare this film to the books. But since this is, as I understand it, a *film* internet database, I would hope that this puts me in a better position than many of this film's critics here. \n",
            "Rating: , Review: There's no story here at all.  Harry P. and company move from one disconnected episode to another with little regard for what's come before. The game of quidditch (whatever) seems thrown in for gee wiz; it certainly has nothing to do with plot.  By the time we move through the maze of Hogwart's gigantic cavernous structure (how many wizards are pupils here -- 25,000???) I forgot all about (and didn't care about) that silly red stone. Wonderfully talented cast (Rickman, especially, doing a dead-on imitation of Olivier's Richard III).  Pedestrian, paceless, unimaginative direction.  But when a film makes a billion dollars, that hardly matters.  Actually, the DVD extra features are more imaginative and fun than the film itself.  I understand that kids all over the world are racing towards reading, just to get into the Harry Potter phenom.  That's cool.\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: I've watched this movie a long time ago and I must say, it simply took my breath away. I've read the book and it was as terrific as the movie, it was quite similar to it but it skipped a few bits out such as the \"The Midnight Duel\" and the beginning. But I understand they wanted to make the movie shorter and enjoyable and I certainly have no problem with that. I thought the plot was excellent and it fits in with the book (it's a good thing that they didn't skip a chunk of bits out from the book and made the plot very different from the book - who wants that?) and I must say all the characters from the book was the perfect choice for all the characters in the movie, such as Dumbledore, he looked exactly like the person in the back cover, which of course was Dumbledore. So all the choices for the characters were all incredibly realistic and makes the audience picture them in the book. The performances from the wonderful cast were out-of-this-world! All of them played their role very well and realistically, including Daniel Radcliffe (Harry Potter), and I believe it was his best movie yet! And the special effects used in the movie was, again, incredible! They were used at the right time, in the right place and they looked absolutely tremendous, in other words, REALISTIC! The castle looked incredibly amazing and all of the other settings/costumes etc. were one in a million. The beginning was good, but in my opinion, there should be a story-teller telling the people who haven't read the book what happened in the very beginning of it (introducing the Dursleys, what they do, something strange going on in town and even how Harry's parents died) so that could be an improvement, rather than just cutting to the action at once which makes the people who are not familiar with the book unsure. But they did some fantastic work after that, introducing Harry and how his miserable his life is with the Dursleys and it was very clever what happened in the zoo, making the snake talk to Harry, which that sort of unfolds the secret of him being a wizard so that was great as well. The Letters From Hogwarts were very clever too, but Harry's uncle kept on ripping them up, which makes the audience know that something weird is going on and I must say when the letters flooded the house, I was laughing my head off! And finally Hagrid came to the rescue right on Harry's 11th Birthday! Which makes the audience have a mixture of feelings, scared/wondering who it is at the start and relived that all the secrets his aunt and uncle kept from him is being told, including Harry's a wizard! At the pub everyones staring at Harry and shaking his hand, it makes you feel that you want to be be him too! And that an ordinary boy actually turned out to be a wizard and not get defeated by the the great wizard \"Voldemort\" (a dark wizard who killed Harry's parents but not managed to kill Harry) and also the name was very clever! When Harry met Professor Quirell, we got a completely different thought of him! He is a good guy, who is quite shy and stammers, but secretly he's a villain! Diagon Alley was amazing too, one of the greatest setting from the movie, which gives the thought of it's a place, where of course wizards go to but actually it's a normal alley, full of shops and people! And all the stuff in the shops, makes you want to have it such as owls and the Nimbus 2000! Gringotts was brilliant too, full of goblins doing work and while getting Harry's money, a secret jumps out, something is hidden in a vault but what could it be? Which makes the audience desperate to know the answer and they want to watch more and more, so that is a great way to keep them entertained. Discovering his wand was great, two wands that won't connect to Harry, but strange wand did! Amazing! The Journey To Hogwarts introduces more characters such as, Ron and Hermonie, and that is when their friendship is formed. Hogwarts Castle was remarkable, the makers tried so hard to make a real castle and they eventually did! Then we meet all the other characters and some are Harry enemies such as, Drace and Snape and then we find out Harry has been placed at Gryfindoor House, with all his other friends, so that is a great start to the year! And then we come to the mystery of the stone, which is truly captivating and grabs the audience and that is where the adventure begins and Harry faces new challenges such as Qudditch, fighting with a huge mountain troll and solving the mystery of the stone! So I strongly recommend you rent this movie on DVD/Video turn off the lights, grab the popcorn and get ready for two hours of pure fun and excitement! If you loved the book, you will love this!\n",
            "Rating: 9, Review: I was so excited to hear about the Harry Potter movie and I couldn't wait to see it. When I did, I was very, very satisfied with the results. The movie sticks to the book so well (without minor scenes), and every image is so satisfying and enjoyable to watch. The characters practically jump out of the book and the roles of Harry, Ron and Hermione are very well acted (not to mention Snape, Dumbledore, McGonagall and the Dursleys). All of the imagery is so believable, it looks like they didn't use computer graphics at all! These scenes include the Quidditch game and the large chess match, and those are only two of the unbelievable scenes. The entire two hours and 30 minutes is so tremendously worth it for all fans of the Harry Potter books, however the movie is not an excuse for not reading the book. The movie is amazing and realistic, but it lacks the sense of reading the book.\n",
            "Rating: 3, Review: They bragged this movie up way too much. It was too anticipated and then when it finally came it was no good. I guess the plot line is good. But, how could this book have become so famous? The acting and special effects in it were great, but I didn't care for the plot line. I don't even know why they would have made the movie of this to begin with, the movie and the book were completely different. This movie has angered a lot of people due to that fact. I suggest... MAYBE... seeing this just to the fact that it's \"Harry Potter,\" not saying that I'm a big fan of the book at all... and I'm not. This was really just an excuse to get out on a Saturday night. Give it a try. It's just not something that I'm interested in. I give it a 3/10.\n",

It was cool because my whole grade got to see it on the first day of its release. The acting was a little bit of a letdown, but hopefully by the second movie the actors will be more confident. I think the special effects were pretty good, but the Quidditch match was excellent. And another thing that made this movie not as good as people expected was the fact they left out some important events from the book, and they made some changes that affected the whole movie.\n",

            "Rating: 8, Review: I've never read this, or any of the books in the series, but I don't think that was an impediment to enjoying the film. The plot seemed heavy on exposition, but I suppose that is to be expected with the first film/book in a series.\n",
            "Rating: 1, Review: Acting and Casting:  pretty good.  Maggie Smith and Robbie Coltrane steal the show.  The three kid actors are ok, but I've seen better in TV series. Richard Harris is ok, but is just not Dumbledore.  Too serious by far. Better would have been Graham Crowden or Freddie Jones, both could have brought just a little bumbling into the character.  Alan Rickman is good, but is not menacing enough.  In the books, he simply oozes nastiness, in the film he's bland.  Both the Richard Harris and Alan Rickman problems are directorial errors, rather than lack of abilities on the part of the actors.\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: As one who got into the story of Harry Potter through my kids I found the books to be excellant.  I was as concerned as everyone about how well this would be translated onto the screen, (I remember 'Dune') I needn't have worried.  The film could not possibly have adapted all of the book.  The most important thing is that the film caught it's essence, it had done this and some.\n",
            "Rating: 7, Review: I really don't see what's the big deal about everyone stomaching Harry Potter just because Chris Coulumbas directed it,and it's a kids movie. The movie is really good,and chris coulumbas is not that bad of a director. The movie has great special effects,good acting,and the way the movie is laid out is brillant. (the effects are way better than the ones in Episode II) The best seane is the Quiditch seane. Basicly the movie is aimed at pre-teens and young teenagers. This might even be better than LORD OF THE RINGS. At least this one ended!\n",
            "Rating: 8, Review: A tad long, but otherwise an enjoyable time. The young trainee wizards and witches were perfectly cast, and I loved the spunky Emma Watson as Herminone Granger...a real scene stealer. And how could one lose with a faculty that includes Alan Rickman and Maggie Smith? The late Richard Harris may be difficult to replace as the headmaster...perhaps a promotion for the hulking Robbie Coltrane? I saw the film on HBO so I perhaps missed out on the special effects, which were effective even on a television screen. As I write this review the new episode of Harry Potter is breaking all-time opening records, so I guess I'll just go stand in line.\n",
            "Rating: 5, Review: I seen the previews and I knew that it was geared towards kids. My friends and family however insisted it wasn't and they dragged me to go see it. I watched it. I enjoyed some of the special effects. I like the concept. However, it was way too geared towards kids. There wasn't much of anything there that was that entertaining story wise. Mostly it filled the screen with childish slapstick humor. Don't get me wrong. Slapstick is fine. Just not childish slapstick. I did however give this movie a 5 out of 10.\n",

            "Rating: 6, Review: I was VERY DIS-Enchanted by this movie. Wooden acting, special effects that are shoddy, or at best, \"ok\". Return of the Jedi is HIGH ART compared to this snore-fest. Parents, do your children a favor, and introduce them to The Wizard of Oz before THIS mess, and watch how their good taste in film will come alive with Oz, and how they will FALL ASLEEP with this clunker. I really like Bicentennial Man (directed by Chris Columbus as well) but I felt NOTHING magical with Harry Potter....it cannot be cause I am an adult.....I still admire Wizard of Oz...I even think Hocus Pocus is cute.....but this movie? NO WAY. 6/10 (and I'm being generous due to the some of the production values)\n",

            "Rating: 9, Review: Skim through the comments, talk to friends, and you'll find out: this is a movie designed for those who have already read the book.  The director C. Columbus has focused on giving us visual interpretations of the scenes, persons and monsters J.K. Rowling described in her story at the expense of her humour, subtle plot twists, and character development, particularly of Harry.  The plot line of Harry's solving the mystery of the Philosopher's Stone (that's the REAL name of the thing--ask any alchemist) is emphasized to the detriment of the more subtle plot of Harry's struggle to achieve self-confidence and a feeling of belonging after his abusive upbringing with the Dursleys.\n",

Not when I checked. I'll be honest, I've never laid a finger on the books, so regarding the accuracy and faithfulness of the book I can't comment on. But A) I understood it, so it obviously stood on it's own. B) The production team, all of it, has created \"muggle\" magic.\n",

I can't wait until the second one comes out though..I haven't read all the Harry Potter books but I'm getting them for Christmas and I can't wait to finish them all.  I couldn't put down Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone...it was an excellent book...I would recommend this book to many people and I give the book an A++++++ but I give the movie a B+\n",

Wonderful adaptation of J.K.

            "Rating: 8, Review: The film is a good representation of the books story. A two hour film can not, however, render all the charming details of the book. To name an example, the moving idyl between Hagrid and dragon baby Norbert got far too less attention in the film.\n",

I have it now on video and have seen it twice and it's great fun. I think perhaps I understand now why kids really gobbled this up. Just the simple fact that kids tore themselves away from the computer games and picked up a book, is an amazing feat in itself. But I salute J.K. Rowling for providing the youngsters with something highly entertaining and that promotes good, positive things for kids -- Loyalty, friendship, teamwork. Not evil and black magic. For all the individuals who claim that the  material in this film is corrupting the minds of youngsters -- need to have their heads examined. Chances are, several of these narrow minds didn't even see the film in the first place.\n",

            "Rating: 9, Review: The first Harry Potter film, and for that reason it had to have an introduction to Hogwarts and how Harry Ron and Hermione became friends. The scenes where Harry meets Ron and Hermione for the first time on the train is a little boring to watch nowadays. It is a vital part of the movie and it had to be there, but I can't deny the scene isn't very spectacular. It wasn't just this scene that was a bit dull though, all the scenes that reveal more of Ron and Hermione's personality are great to watch for the first time but they really lack replay value. They have to be there though for character development For example the scene when Ron making fun of the way Hermione says wingardium leviousa is a little boring to watch now but it's necessary for Ron's character to become as good as it was in later movies.\n",

            "Rating: , Review: Unless you're still too young to earn your own income chances are this movie will not sweep you off your feet and give you the experience the hype has been promising. That is not to say you won't enjoy the film, far from it! With some brilliant acting and a very original plot you can certainly expect to be entertained. However with the lack of some genuine fear and feeling for the characters on screen the promise of `the best movie ever' is a little off the mark.\n",
            "Rating: 8, Review: I had the same doubts many others had, namely: Is it worth the hype? And let me tell you, the answer is a resounding YES. Those who stay away from the books only because an evil advertising campaign has made them annoyingly omnipresent, deprive themselves of the genuine pleasure of reading some of the wittiest and most thrilling books ever written for children and adults alike. In spite of some cliches the critics obviously had to complain about, the story is complex and surprisingly profound considering the target audience. And that is where the true strength of the narrative lies, as the storyteller treats the children like adults - which, of course, makes the books interesting for adults. \n",
            "Rating: 9, Review: The movie is faithful to the novel. It opened the door of the magic world to me. It's so imaginative. I think it is not out of date. I like all the actors in this movie. They all seem to come out of a book.\n",
            "Rating: 7, Review: This is one of the greatest movies I've seen this year, if not the best I've seen this year. It's a great adaption from the book, which was outstanding also. The movie had a great character developement, as well it had great special effects, plot, acting, and everything else you look for in a movie. The movie does live up to it's hype, which is unusual in the movie industry for the last quite a few years. Much to most of your people's and critics' dismay, I liked Pearl Harbor. So for me, Pearl Harbor also lived up to it's hype. But lets get to the Harry Potter issue. Daniel Radcliffe's portrayal of Harry was fantastic, along with his two best friends Hermoine (Emma Watson) and Ron (Rupert Grinn). \n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is the perfect film adaptation of the first Harry Potter book by J.K. Rowling. This extremely well-done movie brings all of the great characters in Harry Potter to life -- Harry himself (played by Daniel Radcliffe), Hermione Granger (Emma Watson), Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint), Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane) and more, as Harry learns that his mother was a witch and his father, a wizard. He has his first adventures at Hogwarts, like learning how to fly a broom, playing wizard's Chess for the first time, and in a twist of fate, a battle with Professor Quirrell who, it turns out, has been harboring You-Know-Who in his very body.\n",

            "Rating: , Review: I had wanted to go and see this in the theatre but husband didn't want to go, I had wanted to rent this on video but husband didn't seem interested. Well on Saturday it was on HBO and we sat down and watched it and guess what?  We both loved it.  I cannot tell you how much of a joy it is to see a blockbuster, big dollar movie that contains an almost exclusively non-american cast.  Richard Harris was wonderful as Dumbledore, Robbie Coltrane a pure joy as Hagrid (I shouldn't have said that I really shouldn't have said that), Maggie Smith all stern and in her best \"Jean Brodie\" mode, and even the supporting characters were an absolute joy, I mean lets face it John Hurt in a bit part?  (I can't wait for #2 when I believe Mrs. Weasly comes into her own, more power to Julie Walters).  The child actors were such a wonder, even though, I admit that Hermione was a little irritating at times (but perhaps that shows what a good job she did, I mean isn't she supposed to be irritating?)  The entire cast was wonderful and I cannot say how much I enjoyed this movie.  I have not read any of the books, (shame on me) so I am not in the unfortunate position of having a \"vision\" in my head as to how things should be.  I must admit having read many things about it I am dissapointed that Rick Mayal's turn as a poltergist was cut, oh well that's life, perhaps we shall see him in the future.  Excellent movie and I await the sequel with baited breath.\n",

Its funny and a watchable to watch even throe it does have some scary scenes in it like the three headed dog and the two face guy when he takes his turban off. The characters are very likable in this film as they are in the book. The castle is beautiful being filmed in Scotland. I would give this movie 10 stars deposited one flow and that being too long \n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: I've enjoyed Harry Potter movies. My whole family are huge fanatics as well, especially my cousin. We've seen all the movies through the very end. I've also gone to the universal studios world in spring break with my sister. We went to Hogwarts, Diagon Ally and Hogsmeade. I like it so much. When I was a kid, being dumb and stupid, I decided to hurt myself trying to put the lightning in my forehead and to becoming harry potter. As a fan, I can tell that these movies are magnificent. It is like DUMBLEDORE said: \"it is our choices Harry, that show what we truly are, far more than our abilities\"\n",
            "Rating: 9, Review: Wow. That's all I have to say.  A wonderful adaptation of one of the best books I've read in a long time. However, I can't wait for the sequels. As great as Sorcerer/Philosopher's Stone is, it's the \"worst\" of the series, with Prisoner of Azkaban being my favorite. Christian Bale as Sirius Black? I'll keep my fingers crossed...but I digress. I thought that they put as much of the book as they possibly could into the movie, which also worries me...all the books get continually longer, and the first movie was already 2 1/2 hours long, AND they cut all the scenes with Peeves AND pretty much the entire Norbert storyline. BUT STILL...Alan Rickman is brilliant as always, Richard Harris is very good as Dumbledore, and the rest of the cast I have no complaints about. Great job, Chris. Just don't screw up the rest of the series, ya hear????\n",

            "Rating: 6, Review: Clearly there is a dearth of literature in this country.  I sat down to read Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone expecting a prime example of children's literature - what I got was a good story residing in a mediocre book.  It was something akin to the novellas of Robin Cook.  J.K. Rowling seems to have been given the tremendous gift of imagination.  She creates a whole world outside our own to show us how Harry Potter learns to be a wizard, unfortunately, she lacks the grasp of the language required to turn her imaginings into a great work of children's literature.  She is not to be blamed for it as it is a very rare gift, shared by greats such as Roald Dahl and in a different way, Dr. Seuss.\n",
            "Rating: 5, Review: The film version tells a weak story.  Harry never has to work for anything (money, quittage, the stone itself.)  Instead, he is rescued by a centaur, is freely given a great deal of cash, is suddenly in possession of the stone.\n",
            "Rating: 7, Review: If you asked me which was my favorite Harry Potter book, I'd have a tough time telling you.  I've read all four to date, and thoroughly enjoyed each one.  What makes the books thoroughly captivating is their combination of the big and the small; quiet self-discovery and rollicking adventure; magic and the ordinary world.  So, what went wrong with this movie? \n",
            "Rating: 7, Review: When I read the first book, I found myself disturbed by it; beneath the surface humor and the compelling fantasy world, there was a darker edge. I found myself unable to read more. I went to see the movie, expecting to find the dark edge gone, reduced to light and enjoyable kids' fare; I wanted to discover that the edge was only in my own mind. Instead, I was surprised to see these kids bleeding and being hacked at by magicked stones with swords. The dark edge I had felt in the books was magnified on the screen, not diminished. The flying keys being rammed into the closed door was a shock for me--these little kids are messing about with rampant and powerful evil. The defenses around the stone were meant to be strong, and they were supposedly cast by \"good\" people, but they were intended very seriously to kill indiscriminately--how \"good\" is that? I felt that the explanation of Harry's survival as having \"skin covered with love\" fell a bit flat for me, and the physical abuse in the opening sequence was accompanied by Exorcist-type supernatural disturbances (I found myself almost feeling bad for the Dursleys, being attacked by all that mail! Almost--but not quite.) Perhaps if this film was aimed at the 16-26 demographic and was billed as a film with a dark edge to it, I would not have been surprised by the presence of darkness. However, as a children's movie, I found it seriously lacking.\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: Before this weekend, I gave only 4 movies (of over 200) an IMDB rating of 10.

Unlike a lot of people, I know that the bloom is more or less off of the rose.  \n",
            "Rating: 8, Review: I saw this film at the first showing on opening day, not because it excited me THAT much but because my friend paid.  I had read all the books not because I love that kind of book, but because I had a few long plane rides. My attitude toward this whole Harry Potter phenomenon is that it's a great way to get kids to read; the books are fun, but I don't think any of it reason for excitement.  So the movie version, in my opinion, should bring something really special, after all it is a scapegoat from reading the books.  \n",

            "Rating: 5, Review: Harry Potter was actually not bad; considering the director, I assumed it would be horrid as his other films.  It was a trace stodgy at the beginning, with much-too-much time spent with the awful relatives (this could have been a brief, effective montage during the credits--we know he's miserable, we don't need twenty minutes of beating over the head to \"get it\").  And we could have dispensed with the entire train ride; just because a scene is in a book, does not mean that it MUST be in the movie--movies and books are not the same medium, and a film needs to travel at some sort of a clip. But once Potter got to school, I rather enjoyed myself.  With the exception of the ghastly Emma Watson as Hermione (an awful, awful little actress who mistakes enunciation for acting), the performers are enjoyable and funny. Maggie Smith and Alan Rickman are always a delight, and they really set a pace in their scenes that the rest of the movie lacks.  Some of the effects are grand, some are rather lumpen, but the movie is by and large trying so hard to charm us that you have to give in or feel like a curmudgeon.  I gave in.  I had a diverting afternoon.  Oddly enough, I took my children (8 & 10) and enjoyed it MUCH MORE than they did.  I won't say this isn't a children's movie; it's just too long and there isn't that feeling of awe that the best children's films can evoke in a child.  They both thought it couldn't hold a candle to \"Shrek\"--a movie with more of an and-then-what-happened vibe. Harry Potter needs to soar; this movie doesn't, but is enjoyable nevertheless.\n",
            "Rating: 7, Review: Nope, haven't read any of the books. Even so, I can appreciate a film that's well done. The smallest version of the little kids is delightful. They didn't all age well (I'm looking at you, Rupert). The kids did a great job at portraying their respective characters. This sole performance of the original Dumbledore was sublime. His replacement in subsequent films didn't hold a candle to the original. His passing was ill timed indeed. This particular inaugural chapter is rather nostalgic to me, because it was released when my kids were little. I miss those days (older kids have greater difficulties). Christopher Cross directed the children like a true professional. Even my now adult children maintain a special fondness for The Sorcerer's Stone. It remains, and ever will, a staple in our hard copy collection.\n",

            "Rating: 8, Review: This movie is simply magical, and I think that, along with introducing you to the wizarding world, is the entire point. Their are so many details that enrich the story, which can be found in the costumes, props, and the magnificent sets. Also, Chris Columbus does a fine job at directing--several sequences were really well done, and you can tell he's good at working with the younger actors.\n",
            "Rating: 9, Review: I hear a lot of people complain that this film is just the same as the book. Personally I can't see how that's a bad thing. After seeing huge liberties taken with the work of some of my other favourite authors such as Tom Clancy and Tolkien I think it's a relief to see a film that tells the same version of the story that became a hit. When I read a book I do picture how it might look on screen but I don't sit there thinking, \"I wonder how this would look if the director decided to add his own spin on it. I imagine seeing it the way it's described in the book. This film provides an exceptional visualisation of the story that fans of the book have come to love. After all, if the version in the book wasn't good enough, it wouldn't have become popular enough to be made in to a film in the first place.\n",
            "Rating: 7, Review: I enjoyed Harry Potter And The Philosphers Stone (or Sorcerer's stone as they call it in America), it was wonderful the writing was great, and the characters and setting and the magic was all there...A truly Great Film...here's the plot..Say you've spent the first 10 years of your life sleeping under the stairs of a family who loathes you. Then, in an absurd, magical twist of fate you find yourself surrounded by wizards, a caged snowy owl, a phoenix-feather wand, and jellybeans that come in every flavor, including strawberry, curry, grass, and sardine. Not only that, but you discover that you are a wizard yourself! This is exactly what happens to young Harry Potter in J.K. Rowling's enchanting, funny debut novel, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. In the non-magic human world--the world of \"Muggles\"--Harry is a nobody, treated like dirt by the aunt and uncle who begrudgingly inherited him when his parents were killed by the evil Voldemort. But in the world of wizards, small, skinny Harry is famous as a survivor of the wizard who tried to kill him. He is left only with a lightning-bolt scar on his forehead, curiously refined sensibilities, and a host of mysterious powers to remind him that he's quite, yes, altogether different from his aunt, uncle, and spoiled, pig like cousin Dudley. A mysterious letter, delivered by the friendly giant Hagrid, wrenches Harry from his dreary, Muggle-ridden existence: \"We are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.\" Of course, Uncle Vernon yells most unpleasantly, \"I AM NOT PAYING FOR SOME CRACKPOT OLD FOOL TO TEACH HIM MAGIC TRICKS!\" Soon enough, however, Harry finds himself at Hogwarts with his owl Hedwig... and that's where the real adventure--humorous, haunting, and suspenseful--begins. \n",
            "Rating: , Review: Saw the film last night. I had a lot of expectations going in, but while I still enjoyed the movie, it didn't nearly live up to my expectations. I didn't have a problem with the length, and even though it closely followed most of the book, the book was able to flow, but the movie felt somewhat disjointed. The Quidditch scenes were easily the highlight of the film, and the general sets and special effects were extremely good too.\n",

            "Rating: , Review: This could be a great movie.  The first half of the movie is clever with character interaction and development.  Then the movie falls into the trap of displaying special effects for no reason and thinking this makes a good movie.  Sorry, it doesn't.  Viewers stop caring what is going on or to whom. Mr. Columbus, have trust in the characters and the story.  Skip piling on the gizmos- they are really not interesting!  The kids are cute, the adult actors are fantastic.  The sets are enchanting.  It is a movie that is a must-see for Christmas.  It is a good movie that could have been great. You'll be able to overlook that fact because you'll have fun.

I did not understand what the movie is about until I read the book. I think J. K. Rowling did a good job in writing the story but the movie makes no sense at all. All the plots are not linked up. The characters are bad. Daniel Radcliffe is a very bad actor. Many other better actors could be chosen. I think he was chosen just because he looks like the Harry Potter on the front cover of the book. The costumes are bad. The special effects are bad. The entire movie is not bad but very very very bad.\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: Some special effects don't quite hold up in 2020. But Philosophers Stone is a magical and charming introduction to Hogwarts and the Wizarding World.

            "Rating: 10, Review: I have to say this movie utterly left me flabbergasted. Not having read J. K. Rowlings immensly popular novels, and ignoring the jeers of my friends I went to see this movie with small expectations and returned a huge fan of Harry Potter. Where to begin with what the movie does right. First off is the casting of only British actors especially in the leading roles. To me thinking of some American actor stumbling around as Potter or Granger faking a British accent would have been just terrible. Thankfully Chris Columbus who seems to be the last person I would be praising after Nine Months, decided to steer off from that Hollywood movie machine idea. And speaking of the actors, they all do a wonderful job fleshing out the characters especially the young leads. Daniel Radcliffe finds just the right note making Harry Potter a character every audience member can envy and cheer at the same time time. Emma Watson plays the feisty Hermione Granger almost exactly as she is written in the book with that little bit of tartness I think most young girls have at that age( at least my sister does anyway.) Tom Felton hits just the right note of pure arrogance and prissyness as Draco Malfoy that you just want some to stand up and slap him during the movie. And Rupert Grint has fun delivering some of the funniest lines in the movie while also becoming equally as heroic as his two counterparts when the time calls for it. As for their older counterparts, they all play to greater range than would usually be called for in a movie of this type. Richard Harris is a standout as headmaster Albus Dumbeldore and Maggie Smith shines as Minerva McGonagle. Their not acting because their grandchildren are fans of the books, their in the movie because they believe in what they are performing. Another thing to note is Hogwarts itself. Everything is set to the screen amazingly intricate detail from the great hall to some of the classrooms themselves. Of special note, one of my favorite parts from the book is also one of the best set designs in recent memory, the huge wizard's chess board under Hogwarts. I also liked the fact that they didn't point out most of the special effects (i.e. ghosts, and moving pictures.) Some of these add too the visual flair of Hogwart's while enhancing the overall setting. When they do focus on special effects some are grand and exciting like the quidditch match (WOW) while others just fail to impress like Fluffy the three headed dog. Another thing, and this is very minor mind you is the exclusion of Peeves the poltergeist. As I found him to be one of the funner characters I wish they could have added him somewhere in the movie. Perhaps in one of the scenes involving Harry and his friends sneaking around the school at night while being followed by Mr. Filch the schools caretaker, he could have popped up. Maybe? Anyway thats just a small complaint to an otherwise terrific film. Sure its long, but trust me its well worth the price of the ticket. Take the kids, they might have as much fun as you will watching it.\n",
            "Rating: , Review: The Harry Potter, who is alone in the Dudley's family, got a letter from strange but charming magic school(But, he didn't know that it was from there until someone came). After that, he realized that he's not just a boy, but the only boy who lived in the dark lord names 'Voldmort'. I saw harry potter book when I was in middle school. Harry fascinated me at once, and I became one of his fan. And when I heard it would be filmed, I couldn't sleep well until it has released. The movie was great. It reflected all people's imaginations; many owls, letters, the Hogwart school, and so on. Actors and actresses were also match with its movie. Harry was perfect that I expected. It was for all of people who love magics. But, there were some problems. The worst thing was Voldmort's face. It could not enough to cover adults because it tried to set only for children so his face was so childish. And its structure is too normal and pure so there is a possibility that some people, who want to see some actions and wide fantasy as if the movie 'Lord of the Ring', maybe disappointed.\n",
            "Rating: 8, Review: \"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\" was exactly like the book. Daniel Radcliffe (who plays Harry Potter) is very good, and the film itself is a success. The story is about a boy who somehow was not killed with his parents by Voldemort (you can already tell by his name that he is the bad guy) he is picked up by wizards and then sent to live with his awful aunt, uncle, and cousin. When he is about to turn eleven, letters addressed to him start to come, and when his uncle destroys what he can of them, more and more come. When he turns eleven he is picked up again by a giant wizard by the name of Hagred and taken to Hogwarts: The School For Witchcraft and Wizardry. When he finds out that the intruder eleven years ago is closer than he ever expected, he goes through many horror-filled adventures. A good film, with a cast that match the characters, and a story which is very good, and very scary. I have read the first four that have come out and I am also very eager to read the last three when they come out. The 5th book comes out next summer, and if you have not read any of the books, read the first one, watch this movie, than read the other three, and wait patiently till next summer.\n",

            "Rating: 10, Review: When I first heard of Harry Potter catching on, I believed it to be a fad and grouped it with Pokemon and that ilk of marketing genius. When, however, I stayed with an associate and could not sleep, I was handed the book and told to read it and see for myself. I did and thoroughly enjoyed the experience. The film captures the book well enough and deserves a lot of the same merit. It seems like the actors were grown for the adaption of the book and they were very easily believable. This film may be family fare, but it is also a lot of fun to watch. Its plotline may not be Shakespeare, but its better than 90% of all thats out there and if you were at all excited about the pod race in Star Wars: A Phantom Menace, then the Quidditch scenes in this film are made for you. To be honest, this film did, for me, what Star Wars: A New Hope did and what I had hoped Star Wars: Phantom Menace could do, it made me believe in something fictional and applicable to my real life. To be honest, Luke Skywalker and Harry Potter aren't too far apart, both are the underdog, trapped children of circumstance beyond their control who achieve great deeds and still remain fresh faced and likeable. The reason Rowling's magic may be more likely to last in sequels than Lucas' did in prequels is because there is a certain heart in Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone missing from Phantom Menace. Rowling did what Lucas once did, she makes us believe in the Power of the Heart and Columbus, through casting and great effects, captures what Rowling did with text in vibrant, sometimes over the edge cinematography and graphics that never become too much, but never leave much to be desired. Casting was flawless right down to the never fallible John Cleese as Nearly Headless Nick. Once, Superman made us believe that a man could fly. Star Wars showed us the magic all around us. Now, Harry Potter shows us the magic within ourselves and lets our spirits fly. A true joy to watch and well worth a second or third look at least.\n",
            "Rating: , Review: Back in the mid-1970's, George Lucas started a wonderful saga for children of all ages, children between 7 and 107!  It was wonderful and it appealed to ALL ages, whether or not there were huge amounts of toys to be spawned for the children's third of the fanbase.\n",

            "Rating: 5, Review: The only reason I went to see this movie was because my girlfriend gave me no other option.  However, once I got to the theater, I was really in the mood to try to open my mind up and let this movie capture my attention.\n",
            "Rating: 9, Review: The first instalment of the Harry Potter franchise does not disappoint. It's a light hearted, warm welcome into the wonderful world created by JK. More on the family friendly side, but knowing how the books/ films are going to gradually get darker, it's a nice introduction to pure magic of this world. A very easy, rewatchable film to remind you of everything you first fell in love with about the heartwarming wizarding world.\n",
            "Rating: 8, Review: I've seen this movie alot of times and I really enjoyed it. I am not starting to tell it's plot 'cause everybody knows it. I only wanna say that I think that Emma Watson (Hermione Granger) was the best actress in the movie, and I really don't think that Radcliffe was the right man for Potter's role. I really think that it could of been done better, but than I do not complain about anythin and I absaolutley wanna see the second part\n",
            "Rating: 4, Review: Basically, it's a reasonable movie, but I found it mostly unexciting and uninvolving - to the point of yawning at some points. Maybe it's just a kids movie, but I feel that insults kids ;)\n",
            "Rating: , Review: I know few agree with me but this film went on too long with before any magic or spark appeared.I can count on 1 hand the amount of magic this guy did in the 1st film and half of the secod film.The girl did a lot of spells but not Harry.No I didn't read the books and I don't want to but when these blockbusters come out you feel like something is wrong with you when you feel the movie wasn't all that.I felt like the plot was taken from \"Star\" Wars,\"Gremlins\",Mrs Danvers from \"Rebecca\",\"Annie\" man I could go on.I didn't find any of the characters lovable and most weren't likable for a kid's film.Way too much talk,this guy is so special wizard yet the teachers know he suffering child abuse at home? Plus they send him back and he goes??In the second film a cat is terrorized and sentences are written in blood on a wall yet while Harry and friends deny doing it none of a SCHOOL of wizards can conjure up who did it when they are blamed? Sorry but it was just dumb and made me turn the movie off.Oh yeah the ending to the 1st film was lame,did anybody remember the bad guy when he showed up?I know I had forgot about him!I rate the first film a 5/10 and nothing for 2 &3 since I will not finish them.\n",
            "Rating: 9, Review: When I first went into the cinema to see a film, I was originally going to see K-PAX since I was a huge Kevin Spacey fan. Turns out that the film is going to run late because it's opening weekend for the newest Harry Potter film. Being a semi-Harry Potter fan at the time, I didn't mind, I wanted to see a film at the moment, so I thought, \"Why not?\" My other choice was probably the Disney/Pixar film Monsters Inc, but I was happy that I invested my eight bucks on this film, because it is worth it - or at least more than Monsters Inc - but that's a different story.\n",
            "Rating: 6, Review: I had read the first three books by the time this film came out, and I was so excited for it. I was about 12 years old. Yet even upon the first watch, I thought a lot of the dialogue was very cringey and forced. Chris Columbus is the reason I didn't particularly enjoy the first two movies. They felt like a Disney ride instead of a real story. Not a lot of natural lead-up, explanation, or character arcs. It felt too childish, even though the books were meant for children. Danielle Radcliffe was just starting his acting career and it is hard to watch some of his scenes. For example, the part where Vernon brings him home after the zoo incident and he says \"One minute the glass was there and then it was gone, it was like magic!\" Just laughable. And Hermione was an exaggerated trope. I know it's an unpopular opinion. But once Alfonso Cuarón came on for the third movie, it became the dark masterpiece it should have been. I still love the movie series nonetheless.\n",

            "Rating: 8, Review: I wasn't too thrilled when this first came out.  Of course, I wasn't thrilled about The Matrix either and now it is my second favorite movie. And once again, it happened.  My sister had it on her laptop from a bootlegged Chinese import and I sat down and watched it.  I loved it!  It was so funny and cute.  I am pretty pleased that I hadn't read the books to find out what they left out or how they messed up or anything like that.  I thought it was great.  Just plain fun, not altered or done up or sexed up. It's just something fun to rent for the whole family to watch on the weekend.  I may read the books now, but I think I'll wait until they all come out.\n",

            "Rating: 5, Review: In a few words, I found this film too long, too dark (in the literal sense of the word), too childish and too tiring to watch overall. The technical merit is obvious but apart from that I see no room for serious criticism. Some extraordinary twists in the plot are made in order to make things... as Harry-friendly as possible and the whole thing seems more like a pop-icon celebration than like a... normal / average tale that I could have actually liked. It's as if we're supposed to go into the movie-theater already being in love with the damn kid! The fact that some things are... over-explained is perhaps suitable for the film's intended audience but tiring to an adult and I must also add that I could not help noticing a rather... sexist tone (female characters have a supporting role while the real heros are all male). I'm not one of those politically correct wackos but it's a rather  unpleasant surprise when you think that this is the first major tale-movie of the 21st century!\n",
            "Rating: 7, Review: Of course like all paper to celluloid projects this movie was inevitably going to pose the question \"but is it as good as the book?\" but with JK Rowling firmly in control and overseeing the film production it was to be expected that she would push for authenticity in any case. It is still likely, however, that many die-hard Harry in print fans who have their own image of how it should have been will still say \"not near as good as the book\". But that is possibly more so a reflection on the delights of reading and how the imagination can conjure up an image in ones mind as opposed to being a criticism of the film.\n",
            "Rating: 9, Review: The story is complete and smooth, the construction of the wizarding world preliminary formation, three small actors are acting. Harry's character setting has a mission attribute, perhaps more suitable for children to see, adults see the end, meaning a bit less. It's nice to see the big boss in the background.\n",
            "Favorite first episode of harry potter, Daniel is so cute, RON is so funny, Emma is so smart. The first cooperation between the three children is good at the beginning. Director Columbus is really home alone to shoot more, all kinds of fun and children's thriller. Set; Color; Clothing; Props; Stunts; The use of the camera is amazing. The rhythm was just right, and it was the beginning of the magical world. Suspense, tension, quirky, comedy to enrich the whole film.\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: I saw it! I saaaaaaaaaaw it!! Does this mean I am cool now? As an avid reader of the series, I have to admit I was a bit skeptical of how accurate it would play out on the big screen. Nevertheless, I was SO EAGER to sit through all 2 hours and 32 minutes of it! I COULDN'T BELIEVE THE MOVIE WAS THAT LONG. It seemed more like 15-30 minutes, even though I had to desperately use the bathroom! My mind was completely sucked in; I was so absorbed with the special effects and the simple brilliance of every scene. Unlike so many other movies based on books that I've watched, all the places like Diagon Alley and Hogwarts, Harry's cupboard...were almost exactly like I imagined them! And I was very happy to see that a lot of the actors' dialog is taken directly from Ms. Rowling's books. The kids are great and stay true to their descriptions. (I know that Daniel Radcliffe is practically Harry's twin, but I was a little bummed that he didn't do his hair black...you can just say I'm obsessed with the books.) The only fault I held with it was that the Sorting Hat didn't sing it's poem! OK, so this might seem like a minor detail, I was looking forward to seeing that scene (so was my friend). Overall, Chris Columbus, J.K. Rowling and the cast did an EXCELLENT job!! (For anyone who was confused about Quidditch like I sorta was, when they play you will definitely understand it! It actually educated me!) I think I'm going again tomorrow...if I can wait that long!!!\n",
            "Rating: 5, Review: Ok i saw this movie without reading the books. i was tempted to read the books but i thought it was better to watch the movie as a movie. The movie is well done. IT has some funny parts and the story is really good for a kids movie. THe main problems i hade with the movie was how in 2 and half hours they still rushed to explain things. They would always have some character jump in and explain some really important thing in 2 seconds and then leave.I did hear how the special effects were suppose to be so good and they were just average in my point of view. The acting was good, the story was fine but the end was more of the same. I groaned in pain when everything came together. Same old crap. Take your kids to see it and dont just like it cause it has such big crowds. Remeber one thing.......the movies that are the biggest are the worst. Star wars episode one ( SO bad!!!!) Titanic (ONe of the worst scripts) and THe LOST WORLD ( nuff said) I guess not all big movies are bad but most are. This is just another over hyped movie\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: The Harry Potter movies and books are probably the most read and viewed fiction artistic pieces. It is easy to see why this story was so captivating from the start. The actors, although very young children, do a very good job in going into their roles and depicting a wizard world for us. Also there is a tremendous work of the producers trying to keep focused and without causing too much stress to such young actors, yet they somehow pulled it through. Excellent movie, and regardless of what people might think is not just for young audience, adults, seniors everyone will enjoy seeing this first movie in the series.\n",
            "Rating: 4, Review: Dull predictable over long,full of home counties kiddies from Rada dying to be actors but failing miserably,Like watching St Trinians all over again maybe kids behaved and talked that way in the fifties but not now.For Heaven sake there be must a child in these schools for theater who has some charisma this Harry Potter is dead below the fringe,Hermione is so drilled in elocution she gulps for air with every word pronounced, and apparently Ron is a better acted than the Potter character well that's not an achievement i can assure you.Dreadful\n",
            "Rating: , Review: I had once started reading the book when I was in sixth grade, the beginning was pretty boring, so I couldn't go on. When I heard the movie was coming out, I went ahead and read the rest of it, I finished it about three weeks before the movie came out, and i must say, i was pleased, that I went ahead and read the four books. I went to see the movie about a week after it came out, and it was also very pleasing. I liked the fact that Chris Colombus directed, instead of Spielberg. All the characters were very well acted. The kids were all brilliant, especially Emma Watson and Rupert Grint, all the teachers were well portrayed, especially Snape, and they also did a great job with my favorite character from the book, Hagrid, played by Robbie Coltrane. The visual effects were well created. I think my favorite scene is the Quidditch game, I like all the shots they took from the air, and the scoring of the film was the best thing in the movie. Nevertheless, they missed out some parts of the book that were important. For example, Harry was pretty confident in calling Voldemort by his name, and in the book, he always says \"Vol, I mean, You-Know-Who\". Hermione also says Voldemort's name once, and according to the book, she was afraid of it as well. They also left out the whole story with Norbert, the dragon, and they do not show the reaction of the students for the 150 points that Harry and his friends lost. Apart from those little things left out, this was a very good movie, and I don't understand all of the bad publicity they're throwing to it. I'm looking forward to seeing The Chamber of secrets. 9/10.\n",
            "Rating: , Review: The Harry Potter books are very good and enjoyable but the movie wasn't all that great. It wasn't horrible (remember this is the first time acting for a lot of them),but I think the later ones (like the 3-7th movie) will be better because the actors and actresses will be used to acting. The movie did not have the suspense that the book had, but it tried. The best part of this movie had to be Hermeione's free will to talk back to anyone who messed with her. All in all it was OK.\n",
            "Rating: , Review: As many of us who read the book know, Harry Potter(the franchise) uses the age-old fashion of teaching kids lessons(bravery, friendship, trusting, snootiness, etc.) through a hero that has a power that many kids would love to have, but love more to follow the adventures of. Although some say that it teaches children witchcraft, more of us know that it's a way to hook children into reading beyond the expectations of schools(six year olds reading the 100-600+ page books in just weeks) and teach them lessons that may not be well taught in schools. By having Harry as a hero, kids love to act like him, but they're smart enough to know what's sensible and what's not. Harry Potter plays on that, so they can make children do the right thing for many, not just themselves.\n",
            "Rating: , Review: I hadn't read the book before going to see this, and neither had my son. As part of our agreement, he had to buy the book before he could see it, and having finally saved enough of his allowance, he was able to do both. I had no prior knowledge of the story other than what had been told to me by others. My cousin loved the stories and has read all four of them time and again. I was absolutely blown away by the movie. The costumes were rich and vibrant, the special effects were wonderful, the performances given by each actor, especially the children, were phenomenal. I cant wait to read the book now, and neither can my son.\n",
            "Rating: , Review: The actors were flawless, and in some cases brilliant. There are no special effects that were underdone, or done poorly. The sets are perfect. One might quibble about the costuming, but that's a minor concern and only in some cases; for the most part everyone is dressed as one might expect. So what's my complaint?\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: After many years spent directing mediocre/awful films, Chris Columbus has finally found his fated place in cinema.  \"Harry Potter...\" (thankfully) bears little resemblance to Home Alone but is far more reminiscent of the wonderful mid-80s years when Columbus was writing the likes of \"The Goonies\", \"Gremlins\" and \"Young Sherlock Holmes\" while Spielberg produced them.  Like these older films, \"Harry Potter...\" isn't condescending to the younger audience both in its material (scary moments and violence) and its length.\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: I just recently saw this movie when I saw a commercial for it that it was going to be on TV, so I decided to rent it (since there are commercials on the TV version of it). I am SO glad I did! \"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\" has to be one of the greatest movies I have ever seen.\n",
            "Rating: 5, Review: Two hours and twenty minutes of not being in the know with a full house of unruly kids who all seemed to know all the inside stuff, ....it makes one go to sleep at worst and squirm around in the seat a lot at best.\n",
            "Rating: 5, Review: \"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\" is little kid's eye candy. Funny, crazy and weird creatures and backgrounds appear around every corner, which is fun to behold until a point. This film, directed by Chris Columbus and based on the popular J.K. Rowling novel, comes in at around two and half hours and feels at least that long, if not a little longer. Little kids will probably enjoy it, but after awhile, eye candy can only do so much. Children will enjoy the visual imagination in front of them, but anyone over the age of 13 may be looking for a little more substance behind the characters than this. A 5 out of 10.\n",
            "Rating: 9, Review: This movie truly is a magical experience! I saw it with reluctance, as I found the book to be boring, but this film is the book without the boring bits! It has wit, charm, suspence and great action scenes! This film deserves an oscar for best pic! Hard to find anything wrong in this great picture, it will be loved by children and adults throughout the world!\n",
            "Rating: , Review: The movie is very good and I enjoyed it very much, but I have to say that it is too loyal to the book. A movie is a work of art in its own way, and so is a book, but when one is based in the other, you must put some creativity to make sure it will be good. Changing Aunt Petunia's and Dudley's hair colour is not enough and I found that annoying rather than original.\n",
            "Rating: , Review: I must say that I was very disappointed when I saw this movie. I mean, come on, you would think that they could get a better actor for the lead role as Harry Potter? They also cut out so many important things from the book, they missed the whole essence of why people like the book so much. I hope that they do better on the second one. I must say though, that the Quidditch scenes and the chess board scene were put together very well, so was the castle of Hogwarts.\n",

I had read the book in advance and while I really can't compare the book to the movie, I was able to see my imagination of the scenes come to life, and that was a very magical experience for me! Maggie Smith's and Robbie Coltrane's performances were excellent, yet by far, the three children were the best! The film stuck very close to the book's contents, changing some scenes around and modifying some subplots to keep the film shorter but to the lay person without having read the book, the changes would not spoil the film. I went to see this movie during opening night to witness my imagination take shape...and that did happen and so I am happy!\n",

The quaint and magical atmosphere with wizards and spells is quite a new experience, although the special effects appear below par generally. Most views involving buildings of the college of magic somewhat look like paintings. For those who have  never read the novel, nor are fans of Harry Potter (like me) this is a sort of \"above average\" movie. I would rate is 6.5 out of 10.\n",

            "Rating: 7, Review: I think people will always give it a 10 just for the nostalgia or if they liked the books. It's definitely not that good but still very enjoyable. I can't see why people love it, in my eyes Harry Potter has always been overrated and I see so many people say it's better than Star Wars or it's peak fiction when it isn't. 6.7/10 fair.\n",

            "Rating: 10, Review: I have not read the Harry Potter novels. I should add a \"yet\" to that sentance, because I made up my mind to read them when I walked out of the cinema. This was a fairy-tale, just the way they are supposed to be! It wasn't too cute or too cartoonish, and it didn't leave out the darker elements. That, for me, means that the makers have respect for the audience. This is the kind of movie that children are supposed to see - something that includes the sad and the scary as well as the happy and funny.\n",
            "Rating: 7, Review: I liked aspects of this movie, but the movie as a whole does not stand up to the great movies. Sure the kids all love Harry Potter, but they also love Pokemon, and don't get me started on that. I guess all the hype came from the fact that this phenomenon extended to even the adult demographic. Parents started reading the books as well. So they all went to see this wonderful movie together, so I just had to go. \n",
            "Rating: , Review: When I watched this movie for the first time in the theatre, it felt like there were scenes that I had already seen.  Things that felt so familiar that I felt as if it were already a part of my memory.  Then I realized why I had this acute déjà vu...because many parts of this movie were exactly the way I had envisioned it in my mind when I read the book.  This movie was done very faithfully to the book and it brings it to life.  That is the most amazing part about this movie: for those who have not read the books yet, it serves as the perfect summary of what happens in the first one.\n",
            "Rating: 9, Review: As the beginning of HP series, it is qualified to complete the task, and the explanation to the characters is very clear. Among many other split HP books, this one is the most faithful expression of the extraordinary splendor of the magic world. While explaining the plot, it still does not forget the ghosts, moving portraits and stairs in the college, which were almost absent in the later books.\n",

            "Rating: 9, Review: \"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\" is a great and essential movie to watch. I loved it when I first saw it at the age of 7 years old, and I still do. It brings the world of magic and mystery to your very eyes and brings peoples' imaginations to life. If you haven't seen it, I think that it would be a great idea to watch it.\n",
            "Rating: , Review: I have been an avid reader of Harry Potter since it first came out, before all the hype started. I thought the movie would actually be good. How wrong I was. Let's just face it: sometimes you just cannot make a film from books, especially great ones like Harry Potter. There are exceptions, e.g. The Lord of the Rings and Anne of Green Gables, but this didn't cut it. Draco Malfoy plays a prominent role in the book, and I have come to love him for it. But in here he is merely a background character, although the actor is very good. And there is a plot hole: Hagrid mentions that Snape protected the Stone. However, we do not encounter his enchantment, the potions. We only see Sprout's, Flitwick's, McGonagall's, and Quirrell's. From seeing a '1' on the spine of the Harry Potter video, I gather that there is an intent to make more Harry Potter films. If this film is anything to go by, don't see them. Stick to the books; you're allowed your own visions of the characters then. Rating: 4.5/10\n",
            "Rating: 9, Review: I was blessed to be eleven when this movie came out. Because that only enhanced the experience for me. I was seeing it as if I could be at that school doing that stuff. Speaking of school, when I went to see the movie someone at the theater was taken out of school to see this movie by his mother! She went and got him from school and went to see the movie. How cool is that! The movie stuck surprisingly close to the original story. I remember reading the book before going into the theater on opening day. Their were a few things that were different but they were so minor that I didn't notice. Everybody was perfect in their roles. Alan Rickman was simply dripping evil as Severus Snape. It's probably the best introductory movie out there. And six years later it's still pretty darn cool.\n",
            "Rating: , Review: What a glorious look into the world of Harry Potter! If you have not read these books prior to viewing this movie, then you are selling yourself short of a magical experience. The movie condenses the book into a manageble timeframe, yet retains the over all golden tones of the beautiful wonder that Harry sees on his journey into an unfamiliar Wizard's world. With a keen sense of logic, and an unparalleled deliverance of an addicting storyline, this movie entices your imagination in ways that you never dreamed were possible. You will find yourself wishing with all your might that such a universe existed! A true delight for all ages, The Sorceror's Stone is the introduction to a long series of movies into Harry's world. Here we see it all begin as a young wizard learns of his past, embarks on the present, and etches out his future all in the blink of an eye.\n",

No offense to Kenneth Branaugh (a fine actor and I am still waiting for Hamlet on DVD. HOPEFULLY SOME TIME IN THIS DECADE) but I really really liked Alan Rickman in this part. Anyone know?\n",
            "Rating: 8, Review: I loved this movie. And the people who were picketing outside the theatre need to get a life. I have been watching magic movies for 40 years. I have yet to hear of someone inspired by such movies to go out and turn someone into a toad. It doesnt work that way in the real world. This movie was pure magic. I was however disappointed in the DVD. The \"Special Features\" on the first DVD were nothing more that trailers. No featurette. No commentary. No documentary. The second DVD seems to be all games. If you have children they will probably enjoy it.\n",
            "Rating: 8, Review: I have read the books, and I must say this is very interesting. Now interesting doesn't mean bad, but it could be a bit better. The books were great and the movies were great yet this was, different.\n",
            "Rating: 8, Review: So I may be 17 years late to the Harry Potter fanatics, but better late then never. Why have I been missing out all these years? So if you are like me, and never got round to watching the most known film series then you need to get a move on. It has a wonderful fantasy storyline from start to finish, which is makes you feel so invited into the magical world of Hogwarts.\n",
            "For a film that is nearly 2 decades old now, it was a pleasant surprise how good the graphics were, you truly believe that there is such thing a magic. Another thing that surprised me was the quality of the acting for young adolescents. Even from the first film you can understand to why they were able to carry on for another 7 more, the relationships are already building like a real school environment. Little scenarios in this film are seen as obviously, but the overall view is that after this film, it will make you want to watch the next.\n",
            "What I like about this film is that it can be watched by children, teenagers and adults and passed along the generations. The added humour, jokes and 'sassyness' makes the film lighthearted and enjoyable.\n",

            "Rating: 10, Review: To speak to truth, I felt I'm entertained for this film, of course I know it's not perfect! But Daniel's smile is sweet, Rupert and Emma did their best to interpret the role, the script can't stand out their performance, that's not their fault. However, that's their style for the role, everybody have his own interpretation for the same role. In Taiwan's website, I'm sick & tired to see the comment like\" What a shallow brain you are to see Harry Potter? You should see The Lord of Ring! It's masterpiece you should!\" The content is nearly to be an insult to Harry Potter and I think it's ridiculous. So what? Even Chinese translation I have no patient to read, not to say English version!

            "Rating: 4, Review: I got to admit; when this movie came out, I loved it. It was charming and got a great sense of magic. But it's too cliché in someways... and is it just me; or are they stupefying Harry all the time in the movie? They are saying things like \"Don't you know that?!\" and \"Everyone knows that!\"..... I mean, jeez... have they no respect for beginners at all? Especially Hagrid and Hermione... And yeah, about Hermione; she is really disturbed. She believes her to be a better person than everyone else, and is always bitching around. And when Ron says the fact that actually disturbs her and makes her sad, she is actually running so near them when she passes; it's obvious she DID want their attentions to her... what a bitch. And let me ask you this; why does Harry's scar only hurt.... WHEN HE BLOODY TOUCHES IT?!! That's just plain silly. But I can't get too strict about this movie. Sure, the CGI effects sucks (pointing at the troll especially) and it's a little bit of a silly story. But it's charming, in it's own way. The problem is this though; they didn't stop after this one. J.K. Rowling was also stupid enough to have more books... but you could technical say Voldemort dies in this movie. But NO; he can come back in maaaany more ways.... and I really don't care.\n",

An exciting, enchanting, thrilling, satisfying movie with great casting, special effects, and music.

            "Rating: , Review: It's hard to argue with the box.  This film is likely to be the highest grossing film of all time and, I'll say this for it, it is certainly a lot better then Titanic.  But there still wasn't much to it.  While filming something which originally appeared in print instantly makes it more accessible, as many people can't or won't read, I wondered watching this movie if it is possible to film something as magical as Harry Potter and still have it be magical.  The age old debate about viewing versus imagination is highly appropriate for this film.  Movie technology has become so good that nothing really astounds us any more, and since effects can no longer carry a film, it needs a good story or a fun story to do so. This story, derivative as it is, is not bad, and the movie certainly is fun. The best thing about it is the cast. Every one of them is top notch and bring a humanity to material which could too easily be trite (sometimes it becomes trite anyway, but that probably couldn't be helped).  For that alone, I'm not sorry i saw the film at all.  And, although it is loaded with gimmicks, the gimmicks don't weigh it down the way they often do in other high budget films.  Worth ten bucks, easily.\n",
            "Rating: 9, Review: I have never read, or as much as picked up, any of the Harry Potter books. Still, I went to see this movie with my 21-year-old sister and my 11-year-old brother. The movie serves as a good introduction to the world of Harry Potter. At first, before they get to Hogwarts, everything seemed to simply be underlining that Harry is a wizard without knowing it, but once in Hogwarts, the movie really starts to get interesting. Severus Snape and Quirrel seemed like fascinating characters. I particularly like the scene down in the dungeons, but telling more about that would be spoiling the movie. There were many scenes in this movie that reminded me of other movies. The scene where the owls surround the house reminded me of Hitchcock's \"The Birds\". The scene where the bookshelf drawers fly out reminded me of \"Ghostbusters\". The scene with the shifting staircases reminded me of M.C.Escher's paintings. Perhaps this movie *should* be viewed before reading any of the books, that way you can spend your time enjoying the plot instead of criticising the adaption.\n",

            "Rating: 6, Review: This movie, based on the book of the same name, starts a wee bit too sluggish, features some nice special effects in the later half and gets downright cheesy and predictable at the end. It relays the story of a young lad who discovers he has untold abilities in the art of wizardry and builds thereon with the process of his schooling in said talent. The character development is way too slow in portions and non-existent in others--unless you've read the book, you don't have much chance of knowing who they're talking about, considering they have such weird names. It has moments of neatness (\"sorting hat\", \"moving stairwells\", etc.), but you never feel immersed in the \"Hogwarts\" world. I got the vibe they should have either totally hammed it up or made it quite a bit more gritty. Alas, it appears yet another novel couldn't be properly consolidated into a film format. Still, the kiddies will probably love it and it could have been much worse, although it is a bit too long--I kept checking my watch.\n",

This movie itself was very well made, lots of pretty colors everywhere that give you a true feel of Hogwarts. The candles, the lights, the ceilings, the walls, the grounds outside, the quditch match, its all so beautiful and full of a life on it's own.  Everything was depicted so well, even if things were left out of the book, but that's what the book is there for. The acting of everyone was so brilliant, and special. All the different characters in the big screen, shinning so brightly together like one big smile from beginning to end and every time you think about it. I am very pleased, very happy with this movie; and I was disappointed this movie did not get any awards. It deserves something. It deserves a lot more than that, but I don't know why people will always be so mean in judging towards things like this. 10/10 It's a very fun movie.

Well, I went to see it in the theaters a few weeks after it came out and I was not disappointed! It was very funny and true to the book. Most of the parts of the book were in the movie, and the parts that were left out did not hurt the movie at all. For anyone who has not read the book, Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone is basically about a boy, Harry, who discovers that he is a famous wizard goes to \"Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry\" and has to figure out who is trying to get at a secret package in the school.

            "Rating: 9, Review: Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone is a fun film to watch. I mean, magic tricks, big castle, interesting story. It started the whole legacy of the Harry Potter films, which we have all grown to love over the past 9 years. Wow, has it been that long? Anyway, even though the whole movie seems a little basic. Kid gets letters, kid learns he's a wizard, gets supplies for wizard school, kid goes to school, kid learns, kid learns about evil wizard, kills evil wizard, the end. I know it sound boring here, but I still think it's a overall good movie, which I think is just worth a rental, since you only really need to see it once. I've seen it a few times. I like to watch this movie occasionally. I also think the series could of ended here. I mean, I love all the other films, there great, but I think it didn't need to go on. Sure there all big secrets about Voldermeort but it still didn't need to go on. I'd definitely recommend his movie and the 6 others.

            "Rating: 9, Review: I must say, the significant flaw with this film is it doesn't know whether to provide more more attention to setting up the entire fictional universe or the main plot of this installment.

            "Rating: 8, Review: Going into \"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,\" I did not share the current hype surrounding it. Two reasons: one, I did not read the book, and two, I was a little concerned about the man in charge of bringing the bestseller to the screen. Granted, director Chris Columbus knows how to work with kids, as evidenced in his megapopular \"Home Alone\", \"Home Alone 2: Lost in New York,\" and \"Mrs. Doubtfire.\" I've enjoyed most of his work, even \"Bicentennial Man,\" which many did not. Of course, I hated \"Home Alone 2,\" as I felt it covered familiar territory in rather uninteresting ways. And even though I found his other films to be entertaining at least on a basic level, I also recognized how superficial his work is. Columbus lays on the sap and sentiments in ways that Hollywood loves and film historians loathe (see \"Stepmom\").\n",
            "Rating: 9, Review: Like most people I was really worried about a number of things. First, of course, wether the movie would (or could) remain faithful to the book. This was not too bad. It was a pity for me that they didn't keep in all of the details, but I can understand this, because it would turn into a 5 or 6-hour movie if they would, and that, of course, is way too long. Second, I also had my doubts about the director, yet then again, his Home-Alone-films are great for children. Critics may dislike this kind of movie, but children don't, so why worry about that? Bu I would not like to see Harry Potter turn into a boy who starts crying his eyes out every three minutes. Fortunately, he didn't. Good for him. Third, the special effects. I have seen a lot of movies, with or without special effects, and from my point of view, they're rather disappointing. Therefor, I was absolutely satisfied with the effects of the troll and the quidditch-match. Fourth, the actors. I think nobody looks more like Harry Potter than Daniel Radcliffe. For a child actor, his acting is great. But my favorite is Rupert Grind as Ron Weasly. He is exactly like portrayed in the book. Emma Watson, who plays Hermione Granger, looks a but other than I had imagined after reading the book, but she acts exactly like J.K. Rowling described in her books. Alan Rickman, being one of my personal favorites, is the perfect embodyment of professor Snape (my favorite in the books!!!). It's a shame he doesn't get to show how mean he really is. Maggy Smith as professor McGonagal fits the part perfect, and this also goes for Robbie Coltrane as Rubeus Hagrid. Overall, I think this movie will make it to my favorite-list. 9/10\n",

Perhaps they do not know that witchcraft is a real religion and there are many practicing witches and wizards (a male witch) in this world. I have personally met real witches and there are many documentary films about them.  They are nothing like movie witches but they do practice their religion. This movie is a candy-coated promotional film for the witchcraft religion. Take your children and see if they don't come out wanting to be a witch or wizard. Don't you think it is odd that no other religion is even mention in the film?\n",

When my girlfriend, who had just finished the first book, wanted to see the movie I agreed to go along.  I expected some cheesy Disney-esque kiddie film but was realy pleasantly suprised.  Because of this movie I have now read all four books in the series and as i reflect on the movie I really believe that it was an excellent adaptation of the book, having never read any of the books prior to seeing the movie i enjoyed it alot and i am looking forward to seeing it again now that i know the story better.  The characters and their respective actors were excellently chosen, Alan Rickman as Snape was a really good choice in my opinion.  The only real problem i had with the movie as compared to the book was that in reading the book I got a much darker feeling so when the movie was so bright and cheery i found it a little odd, but other than that i think it was a great book/movie translation.  I'm sure that there are a number of Potter heads (hahaha) that will say thing were left out of the movie, but of course they were, there's no way to fit all the story line of the book into a movie and still have it short enough to hold the attention span of its target audience, as it was the movie seemed a little long for yournger Potter fans.  I am really looking forward to the rest of the movies in the series especialy Prisoner Of Azkaban and Goblet Of Fire and the next book.  If you want to see a really good movie that the whole family will enjoy this is the movie for, well, anyone.\n",

It may even be better because as an adult you can appreciate the cinematic value along with the story. I also never realized how far ahead of the game the CGI effects were in this movie considering it came out in 2001. I thought the Directors / Producers / Designers / etc. Did a wonderful job at bringing a lengthy fantastical book to light in a film that was just shy of three hours. The actors, both new and old, also did a wonderful job at portraying the book characters. I've followed our Golden Trio throughout the years and it's unbelievable, to me, how their careers skyrocketed because of their performance in this movie and throughout the series. I loved watching their friendship blossom and I think they each compliment one another really well. They each have characteristics that are unique to them and I think that's what makes their friendship so great.\n",

Fans of the book, which I did not read, are treated to what I understand is a faithful reproduction of the text.  Although people like me will not know about muggles, hogwarts, goblins, wizards, elves and Sorcerer's Stones, that disadvantage can be overcome.  The wide range of villains and obstacles for our heroes to conquer will satisfy adventure fans.  The unusual number of surprises and defiances of convention should delight magic aficionados. Admirers of good performing will appreciate the ensemble acting of Harry Potter (Dan Radcliffe) and classmates Ronald (Rupert Grint) and especially Hermione (Emma Watson II).  Veteran actors Maggie Smith, Richard Harris, John Hurt and John Cleese ably support them.  Feminists will appreciate how Hermione takes charge in critical moments in an effort to rescue her male companions.  She does it with brains and wizardry rather than force and violence.  I admire her spunk. \n",
            "Rating: 4, Review: I wasn't too excited to see this because I hated the books, but I rented it because there was nothing else at Blockbuster. I will keep this as simple as possible. The movie was way too long. There was almost no story line. When I first saw her, Maggie Smith looked like the woman from The Weakest Link. When we find out who the villian is, we go into the cliche \"stumble onto the real bad guy who revieles exactly how he did everything in plain, simple English.\" This hasn't been seen since last year's Charlie's Angels, which made a lot more sense than this film I might add. Something in particular I didn't understand about the film, If Harry's aunt & uncle hated him so much, why don't they jump on the chance to send him away? I was not impressed with the visual effects, though I did see Lord of the Rings first. Nor was I impressed with the sound effects, or lack there of. To make a long story short, if you haven't seen this film then don't waste your time. \"It's the Wizard of Oz of its time!\" give me a break, it doesn't come remotely close!!\n",

            "Rating: 4, Review: I saw the film in summer 2002 on video, and have recently read through the entire series in less than a month. Upon reading the Philosopher's Stone, I learned how the film doesn't match up the this great book. Several characters are diminished or removed. The sorting hat sequence is shown to be much shorter as well. Yes, Susan and Draco's sorting is shown, but Lavender, Millicent and Neville are left out. Are there only five first years coming to Hogwarts this year? Are the others sorted privately? At the end of this sequence, Dumbledore's \"Few short words\" are sadly absent. Fred,George and Percy's parts are reduced and Bill is absent, leaving Norbert to be taken quietly and mysteriously during a scene change. Lee Jordan is cast much too young and basically becomes \"Quidditch Announcer boy,\" and his ad-libbed commentary is gone. Countless other changes are made to reduce time, yes, but rather sloppily. At times I could tell it was a Chris Columbus film. How about Harry and the gang screaming Kevin-style at the sight of Fluffy, or the lackluster job at adapting the British humor? As for the casting, most of it is well done, with some exceptions. Daniel Radcliffe is OK as Harry, but Rupert Grint's Ron isn't too great. Emma Watson is one of the prettiest child actresses I can think of, but therein lies the problem. I envision Hermione to be a bit of a weird cross between Asimov's Susan Calvin (plain, shy and book-smart) and Alexander's Elionwy (pretty, VERY talkative and oddly intelligent), having tiny bits of each. She's decent looking, but not as much as, say, Parvati or Lavender. She's a buck-tooth, remember. John Cleese's Nearly Headless Nick is poorly adapted, but he strangely receives top billing. All in all, it's better for those who have read the books. Prisoner of Azkaban is said to be a bit more accessible. I have yet to see this... I now wait for July and November.\n",

            "Rating: 9, Review: You've heard enough about this movie; you certainly don't need to read one more glowing review.  So I will just give you some sage advice.\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: I had never read any of the books before, and had only heard about them before I went to see this movie.  I wanted to see it because it looked very good, and the preview reminded me of one of my favorite Chris Columbus films Young Sherlock Holmes.  YSH captures the essence of old Britain with the same magical style as Harry Potter.  When I finally saw the movie, I was presently surprised at the brilliance and wit contributed by the writer, the director, and especially the actors.  It surprised me because I never thought a children's book could become such an involved and magical subject. The child actors seemed more like adults, but enhanced the genius of the film.  When you see child actors in movies such as Jake Lloyd, you watch them closely, as if they aren't as good as the other adults.  These actors were remarkable, especially the three main characters.  But I don't want to give these guys all the credit, let's not forget the excellent adult actors they have in the film.  Richard Harris was especially remarkable as the headmaster of Hogwart's.  Every time I saw him, I thought of a brilliant aged wizard, who knows all and has seen all.  I was also impressed with Alan Rickman's Severus Snape who was a great character and am hoping they continue his presence in the other films.  I have followed Rickman from different movies because I love his acting style, and he was perfect for this role.  Everything seemed to come to life in its own magical way. Kids filled the theater with laughter and surprises.  They were having so much fun with this, and I can only imagine how much better the movie might have been, had I read the book.  A film of this magnitude produces so much hype, it might have turned out to be another dude.  But I can say now that this movie is not just hype, it is entirely substance.  This movie could have been brilliant without the hype.  I completely forgot about the real world when I entered the world of Harry Potter.  So forget everything, relax, and enjoy a film full of magic and adventures fulfilled only by the wonderful Harry Potter.\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: The Sorcerer's Stone was an excellent introduction to the Harry Potter series. The main focus for this film was the development of the characters. Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter could not have been better casted; he not only did a phenomenal job but also made the character come to life. Rupert Grint and Emma Watson, who played Ron and Hermione were also wonderful throughout the whole film. The other characters such as Dumbledore, Hagrid, and McGonagall may play smaller parts however they are no less impressive. Along with the characters, this film also introduces Hogwarts, which was an unbelievable creation. The journey for the three children into Hogwarts and into each other's lives was very well done.\n",
            "Rating: 8, Review: I think it's still the best one in this series. I was really surprised when I saw it for the first time. The overall setting was exciting. The point is that Harry is the most cute and adorable at this time. The second episode begins to grow slowly!\n",

            "Rating: 7, Review: What else can I say but brilliant. True to it's word Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone kept close to the book. Chris Columbus and the rest of the crew clearly listened to JK Rowling when they were making this. Obviously changes had to be made to the story or we could have ended up with a film of more than 3 hours. Nearly every scene was what I pictured it would be. The special effects were fantastic and the game of Quidditch was very spectacular. All the characters fitted effortlessly into the film and every actor was suited to the part they played. Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson were perfect as are three heroes, but every other actor involved helped to bring the book to life, however brief their appearance.\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: Kind, brave. Very common words. Always kind and brave. Hard to do. He had a miserable childhood, mentally abused by his uncle's family. He probably didn't even know what he was doing wrong, as if his very existence were a mistake. Childhood has a huge effect on a person, and the kind of childhood Harry experienced could easily make a person antisocial. But he didn't. He'd shared snacks with RON the first time he'd met him on the Hogwarts Express, and he'd come to the troll night to rescue Hermione, who he'd just met and had a bit of a problem with. Even though he was only in the first grade, even though he grew up in that environment, he was still a kind person.\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: I loved this movie. It was creative, and it kept my attention the whole 2.5 hours. For those of you who compare it to the book, and thus hate it, lighten up! Forget the book. You are watching a movie, and just try to enjoy that.\n",
            "Rating: , Review: I'm in two minds about this film. I've never read the books so I can't really say if JK Rowling's vision was really realised or not and not being familiar with the character of Harry from the books I only have Daniel Radcliffe's portrayal to go on.\n",

I read the book first cause the movies wasn't out , and J.K.Rowling did a very good job on the book i mean i stayed up late to read a blasted book . And let me tell ya that i don't read books very often , and i don't like'm either . But , but Harry potter was an exeption , read it liked it , and then i went at the movie , and there i got not disapointed but VERY VERY DISSAPOINTED . The subject is way off target , who is harry what's with him , how come harry went to the zoo why , the movie makes no sence until you read the book . I saw the movie , but unfortunetly i didn't finish the first book , from the half of the movie i couldn't understand a THING THAT WAS GOING ON !!! I know it's a movie for kids but do they understand something from the movie cuz honestly i didn't at all . very bad movie i recomend that you buy the book and read it than go to the movie !!!\n",
            "Rating: 8, Review: I had not read any of the Harry Potter-books when this came out but like most people in the world i easily knew who Harry Potter was before I heard they were going to make the book into a movie. After i saw the first film, i could see why people loved the story. The story is very fresh but that isn't something you see lately in other fantasy stories. It also brings in a lot of knew things into the genre that have stayed with us until now. The characters are colorful to say the least and very memorable but that is the main thing when you are writing a series of books, to make the characters likable and memorable. This world J.K Rowling has made is quite charming and beautiful.\n",

            "Rating: , Review: The main character is a boy who is called Harry Potter. He looks an ordinary, but actually he is a wizard. This movie starts from a scene that Harry is put in front of a house. He looses his parents when he was a baby. So, he has been raised by an uncle's family. Being six years old, he gets a letter which informs an entrance of Hogwarts. The uncle's family disagree to that, but Harry decides to go there and learn the magic. He can get two friends in the school. They are Ron and Hermione, and they becomes best friends of Harry later. Through the all series, they fight against a bad wizard whose name is Voldemort who kills Harry's parents. In this movie, a teacher whose name is Quirrell is an enemy. He is a minion of Voldemort and looks for Sorcerer's Stone. Harry, Ron, and Hermione can defeat him and can prevent him from getting Sorcerer's Stone. I'm very excited. I enjoy the world of magic.\n",

You don't get the textures that you get from the book, how really rotten the Dursley's are, how much Harry longs for his parents and the most important part his mothers love is what probably saved him from Voldemort. It is so much sweeter in the book(and I don't mean sickening)all in all it's just a great reason for everyone to go grab a copy of the book and enjoy the connecting embrodery.\n",

            "Rating: 8, Review: Harry Potter see´ms to have all the ingredients to make a great movie (good actors, great original story, big budget, John Williams -sound track) but somehow it fails to really amaze, thrill or laugh. I haven´t read the book, but I still got the feeling that a lot of good material had been hacked of; everything went by too fast and the film concentrated on nothing for long enough to make an emotional impact. This may be partially due to the bad director (Columbus) whose style is devoid of feeling or flare. All the actors are great, which is quite an achievement considering there is not only one childstar, but three! Anyway, it´s good but not great. I think I´ll read the books now. And wait for Lord of the Rings.\n",

            "Rating: 9, Review: I think this movie is very attractive to me. The Harry Potter film series is the world's highest grossing film series with over $ 7.7 billion in multi-national release. British writer J · K · Rowling's fantasy literature series novel describes the protagonist Harry Potter's 7 years of study at Hogwarts life adventure story, directed by Chris Columbus. Harry is the hero of the story. He is an adventurous child, I have to search for information about Harry display state among the living, so in real life Harry is a very brave and very clever boy. The film's score is also superb, seven out of ten, but the real wizards are JK Rowling, Chris Columbus, Steve Kloves and every member of this wonderful cast and crew bring it to life. Thanks to this movie I have some knowledge of magic stories. I will always support Harry.\n",
            "Rating: 7, Review: Robbie Coltrane and Emma Watson are the best reasons to see this movie. Both are consistently quite good. Daniel Radcliffe gets better as the film progresses and I can see that he could be good as Harry Potter in the sequels.\n",
            "Rating: 8, Review: To be put simply Harry Potter is: Very Entertaining. It was at times slightly mundane, but I put that down to the fact that I had read the book only a day before, so I knew every scene that was coming.\n",
            "Rating: 1, Review: This was a rather interesting experience. Take a bunch of kids who can't act, add some truly horrendous special effects, add some of the largest plot holes seen in a movie and you have a simply unwatchable pile of garbage. The movies definitely get better but the first two simply should not have been made. To show that I'm not merely spouting steam I'd just like to point out the largest of said plot holes. It is a rather important point to the story that Snape helped protect the stone. It is basically all that is talked about by Hagrid yet, somehow, the director forgot to put Snape's protection of the stone into the movie. It really is too bad that this turned out to be bad enough that I have a hard time calling it a movie.\n",
            "Rating: 9, Review: I think it's testament to Hollywood and previously mediocre director Chris Columbus that they spent a vast amount of time and money on an entirely foreign film, while demanding nothing from it in the way of big name actors, product placement, gratuitous sex & violence or Americanisation. They really do deserve the return on their investment after demonstrating such faith in its success.\n",
            "Rating: 9, Review: (EAPP11_REV2016) Harry Potter and the Philosopher's stone is the very first book in the J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter series. Its film or movie remake was released in November 2001 directed by Chris Columbus and produced by David Heyman. As you know, some call this film the Philosopher's Stone and some call it the Sorcerer's Stone. The explanation behind this is that the \"Philosopher's Stone\" is the British name and the \"Sorcerer's Stone\" is the American name. For those who haven't watch the movie yet, I'm going to give you a little glimpse. There was once a boy whose true identity was suppressed from him by the family who kept him for 11 years. When he turned 11, someone came to reveal his true identity which changed his life for the better. That boy is Harry Potter. He entered a school of Witchcraft and Wizardry named Hogwarts. Here he discovered a whole lot about himself and developed friends. This is where the all the magic began. If you would compare the book from the movie, there are some parts or chapters in the book that was not included in the film and there are some that were in the movie but not in the book. Nevertheless, the portrayal of the book in the movie was still great and those parts that weren't included in the movie did not affect the plot of the story unlike other movie remakes of other novels where they completely changed the plot line. If you want to know the chapters or parts that were not included in the movie, you may want to read the book first before watching it. The cinematography is quite amusing because knowing that it was released in 2001 where technology wasn't that advance as it is today. The graphics or visual effects were okay because it doesn't look like that it was fake or that edited. Of course, as the series go on with the other films, the effects were highly improved as technology evolved. The choice of music perfectly fits the movie because for me, classical music best fits the theme of magic and mystery. I can't imagine the film with songs or music that have lyrics or are of different genre. The choices of stars/artists were perfect where Daniel Radcliffe starred as Harry Potter, Emma Watson as Hermione Granger, and Rupert Grint as Ron Weasley. They were really adorable in the movie because they still have that young charisma that's why it doesn't matter who or what age is the person that'll watch this because they'll feel that it is not old. I can't even imagine anyone who can portray the role of Harry Potter if it was not Daniel Radcliffe because even if he starred in other movies I'll always call him Harry. Harry Potter was released for a long time now yet more and more people, children and adults, are still very fond of it. Even if they weren't born in the earlier years of 2001, Potterheads will always come back to the very first episode of the Harry Potter Series. I, myself is a big fan of this. There are a whole lot of plot twists and mysteries that are shown in this movie as well as in the other movies of the series. I'm telling you, Harry Potter will take you to another world full of enchantments that'll make you believe in magic.\n",
            "Rating: 7, Review: I love Harry Potter movies, of course not like Lord of the Rings or Game of Thrones, but I love them, they're fun. This was the first movie from that series and as far as I'm concerned, one of the best, everything was innocent, there wasn't a lot of Voldemorts who want to take over the world or some horcrux but just childish and naïve fun. For a lot of nostalgia, watch this movie.\n",

            "Rating: 2, Review: With the exception of a few impressive visual scenes, this film is unbearable. I generally like kids, but this film had me rooting for the bathroom ogre and the 3-headed monster dog to eat all children in sight, especially the three principal actors. They're awful - mostly due to painful overacting for which we can blame poor direction. If Hermione doesn't get on your last nerve, nothing will. Yeah, so the film has some heartwarming positive messages, but the characters are so non-endearing and the storyline is so mechanical that in the end, you just don't care.\n",
            "Rating: 9, Review: I think this is a great movie for both kids and adults. The fairy tale about the wizard boy just won me over - I read the book \"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone\" and did not regret it at all. She instilled in me a love of reading. The film adaptation is very good, the special effects are excellent, and all the feelings from reading the book are not changed by watching the movie. All the actors are perfect for the heroes of the novel =) Of course, Chris Columbus is a good director, and I'm very sorry that he did not take on the 3rd, 4th and 5th films, I'm sure he would have done it much better than Alfonso Cuaron and David Yates.\n",
            "Rating: , Review: well, I never really took a fancy to anything Harry Potter related when I was smaller, but ever since the Chamber of Secrets started playing on Cinemax a lot, and the fact that most of my friends were into it, I thought \"All right, I'll see what all the buzz is about.\" So I borrowed the first movie from my friend before we went to go see the Prisoner of Azkaban, cuz I wanted to get how this whole thing started. I really enjoyed it actually. This one still remains my favorite so far, because it follows the book, which I only finished reading yesterday, really well. \n",

            "Rating: , Review: This movie was incredibly good in its own sense, but being a complete nerd about these books, I have to say that the movie is woefully inadequate. Danial Radcliffe seems too wimpy for Harry Potter. He should be a little awkward but in this movie he's a complete pansy. All in all, it was a pretty good book to movie transition but it was not anywhere near as good as the Fellowship of the Ring\n",
            "Rating: 9, Review: This movie was good. It did a good job describing the book and was very exciting. They didn't make it too dark and evil and they didn't focus it all in violence. However, I do think they should have included Peeves, a character in the modern classic by J.K. Rowling. They also made it kind of too fun. I personally think that they could have made it a tiny bit darker and a little more violent. Overprotective parents, do not fear, this movie is rated PG and is not super evil and destructive. I recommend that kids nine years old and up watch this. They had good acting, and should be rated four or five stars by fans. This will always be a fun classic full of action, and deserves to be in everyone's movie collection.\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: I loved this movie! I think Harry Potter is going to be a great series. I liked how the characters seemed real not only in the movie but in the book as well and the whole thing with Snape and Quirl kinda got me more into the series. I think I could really understand it because J.K. Rowling really described the characters well. I would have to say I can't choose a favorite character between Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, or Hermione Granger. Harry is so adventures, exciting, and sweet, Ron is very funny, sweet, and outgoing,and Hermione is smart, funny, and sweet. I just think that they are all great. Overall i would give the movie an off the chart reading.\n",

            "Rating: 7, Review: Readers seem pleased that the movie seldom strays from the book. Steven Kloves' screenplay seems to be a transcription of J.K. Rowling's first Harry Potter novel. Unfortunately, this means that some adult viewers might be glancing at their watches as the movie slowly resolves the plot. I noticed that the film's length posed no problem for older children in the theater when I saw it. (The kids seemed to know the story, so there probably weren't many surprises for them.)  I must commend the screenwriter for doing his best with Rowling's major plot twist -- which I had found a bit awkward when I read the novel. \n",

            "Rating: , Review: I saw magic last night.  Sitting there in the theatre at six in the evening, about to watch one of the most anticipated movies ever made, I decided not to compare it to the book, rather I would enjoy it for what it was and not to nitpick it. What I saw was a stunning movie that substituted fancy action sequences (although there were some real knockout sections) for a heart and soul. Daniel Radcliffe was an AMAZING Harry.  Not only did he look exactly the way that I thought he would, he has very good acting skills for an 11-year old kid. Rupert Grint and Emma Watson were also great. Rupert was so adorable and funny, and Emma's Hermione was just as I thought she would be-stuffy on the outside, but on the inside, a genuine and kind person. Professor McGonagall was amazing. Maggie Smith did a very good job of playing her. However, the kid who played Draco Malfoy was awesome! He was such a little snotty brat that you loved to hate him. \n",
            "Rating: 8, Review: I will always think fondly of this movie because it inspired me to pick up the first Harry Potter book and I've been a rabid fan ever since. I'm one of those book before movie people so I had to read the novel in order to go see this movie and I was pleased to see that it was such a faithful adaptation to Rowling's wonderful tale. This movie did a wonderful job of capturing the wonder and awe of the first HP novel. Hogwarts was an especially lovely effect and when Harry first walks into the Great Hall and all the candles are floating overhead, I felt all the magic I felt when reading those words on the page. I think Columbus and crew captured the essence of the castle and somehow managed to create a visual of something so fantastical. The casting of the movie was also extremely well done. I adore Maggie Smith as McGonagall and Richard Harris captures the mischievous and wise nature of Dumbledore. Perhaps best of all the adult casting is that of Robbie Coltrane as Hagrid. He looks exactly as I pictured the character but, more importantly, he captures Hagrid's rather childlike nature and the accent is wonderful. Coltrane doesn't just portray Hagrid, he is Hagrid. I also thought the children were wonderfully cast. Daniel Radcliffe looks like Harry and I fought back tears when his earnest young face first looked into the Mirror of Erised. Rupert Grint looks just as I pictured Ron Weasley and Emma Watson is wonderfully bossy and a fantastic know-it-all as Hermione Granger. The casting of the Phelps brothers as the Weasley twins was absolutely brilliant and I think they were dead on in their interpretation of the lovable scoundrels. Yet in spite of its fantastical nature, this film, like the book, feels as though it is something like our own reality. There are many wonderful things in Harry's world but it's not that different from our own. The same prejudices and the same human frailties that exist in our world exist in Harry's. Though being a wizard is pretty darn cool, it's not the answer to Harry's problems and the film makes clear that he has some difficult challenges ahead of him. I think the central theme of this movie is one that is invaluable for both children and adults alike: that love is the most powerful magic that exists. Even with all the wand waving and fantastical creatures, it is love that is Harry's salvation.\n",
            "Rating: 4, Review: I really enjoyed reading the books, and I like being captivated by good narration - but this movie did not even come close to expressing all the magic that was in the story. The movie just felt bland, like sipping water and longing for an extraordinary Chardonnay - I don't know how else to put it. This movie just does not work.\n",
            "Rating: 7, Review: This film is phenomenal. The CGI looks good during its time and a bit goofy now. The music scores are.... perfection. The child actors a bit cringey but that just me.

            "Rating: 6, Review: With the movie finally here out in the open it's hard to say if expectations weren't too high. It all sounded good: a fine cast & J.K. Rowling being mainly involved. Could this go wrong?\n",
            "Rating: 7, Review: As an adult with no children and having not read any of the books I was wondering what all the fuss was about. Obviously I can't make comparison or express disappointments between book and film but I can see enough strange, menacing and funny characters as well as myriad incidents to keep most children enthralled for more than two hours. We can clearly see where the money has been well spent in transforming this parallel magical universe into something that George Lucas would put his name to. I was rather surprised by the relatively subdued reaction of the(mostly under 15) audience both during and at the end of the movie, with few fearful gasps or hoots of laughter that makes me wonder that my simliar behaviour was not so off the mark. I feel there is not very much in this film for most adults (or their inner children) especially when one compares it to brilliant efforts like the Toy Stories, Shrek and not to mention all the Simpsons episodes. I'm sure my commentary is quite irrelevant to all the kids still waiting to see it (or see it again) so call my reaction humbug and I await a visit from the Ghost of Hogwarts Past anytime now !\n",
            "Rating: 7, Review: Good performances from: Emma Watson did a nice job, Robbie Coltrane was very good if not under used. Alan Rickman was very good.  I am still trying to decide if I like the sidekick Ron Weasley portrayed by Rupert Grint.  Danial Radcliffe was flat.  For a lead character he just did not have 'it'.  They may have picked him for his looks but not for his star power. They really blew the casting for Harry in my opinion. There were some very good scenes but even the showstopper Quidditch match and the chess match was rushed and boring.  The scene in the forest was very good but again short. The finale I enjoyed but for some reason I kept expecting Voldewort to tell Harry he was his father.....hmmm, Ive seen that somewhere before though. Anyway. This movie gets a 7 from me just because of the attempt, stunning although cold sets and a couple of decent performances from the adults. This franchise is destined to make Billions in hype alone.  NO that is not an exagerration.  Billionssss.  Not deservedly but they will nonetheless.\n",

            "Rating: 8, Review: I read all of the books with great enthusiasm.  The books were well written adventure stories.  The movie followed the book quite well.  Of course a lot had to be left out to keep the movie under 6 hours.  The deletions were quite acceptable to me.  There was not a major character or scene that was omitted.  All movies made from books disappoint a little (or a lot); they just cannot be as good as a book by the nature of the medium (audio/visual representations)as opposed to the limitless possibilites of the human mind and imagination.  Some movies do a very good job of representing what the mind imagined; this one did a fair to good job of it.\n",

            "Rating: 10, Review: I've been a grownup Harry Potter fan since the late summer of 1999, when his name was just beginning to be heard frequently around my area and I was wondering who this kid was.  I picked up a paperback copy of the first book at a local shop and spent a couple of hours finding my way around Privet Drive and Hogwarts School.  When I finished the book, I went back to the beginning and started to read it again.  Since that time, I am, in a word, hooked on the Potter phenomenon.\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: I loved Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone! Sean Biggerstaff (Oliver Wood) was packin some major heat! Not only are Harry, Ron, Hermione, Draco, Neville, Dudley, Seamus and all the rest of the child actors  adorable but they are incredible actors as well. The older cast was awesome too! I loved the sets and the special effects. I can't wait to see the rest of the movies and more of these actors in other places too. It is a long movie but I was captivated the whole time and I can't wait to see this movie again and again (I've already seen it twice)! I know I don't have the right to tell you to go see this movie so all I'll say is if you look interested, then definitely go see it. You won't be disappointed. And read the books! They are so awesome, they are phenomenal.\n",

            "Rating: 9, Review: One of the most wonderful Harry Potter movies, it is excellent. Of course things have been cut out for time but the most important elements are here(unlike later movies). The cast was excellent, I was thrilled by Argus Filch who was kinda scary(unlike later movies) and his cat, Richard Harris as Albus Dumbledore was also very book-like and nice to look and listen at. The movie has only one big flaw and that it's too close to the book. Columbus followed the book almost to the letter and didn't let his own imagination to spice the story up. The sets looked gorgeous. I am sad that some of the rooms in the end were cut. Hagrid had mentioned earlier that Snape had been one of the people who designed the protection of the stone yet his potion riddle was cut along with Quirrell's troll.\n",
            "Rating: 9, Review: After watching the this, I knew that I must watch the sequels and read the books. This film starts off with some funny bits were the Dursleys are yelling at Harry when really it is Dudley being the misbehaved one. Let's remember that this film is set in the 1990s,not the 21st century and yet Dudley still manages to get all sorts of interesting presents. The arrival of Hagrid instantly made you like him. He's my favourite Harry Potter character because he's clumsy and dangerous, a bit like me. \n",
            "Rating: , Review: I have never read any of the books, and this movie definatly did not make me want to.  The scenery is great, but there was nothing else in the movie. The quittage match everyone is raving about was utterly pointless.  It in no way developed the storyline.  Actually, nothing developed the story until about two hours into the film.  What's with the quittage match anyhow?  Why do you get points for something that automatically makes you win the game?? Robbie Coltrane and Alan Rickman at least give something to watch.  They both delivered great performances.  Too bad they didn't have much to work with.  Had this movie been cut to about an hour and a half it might have been tolerable.  But as it is, there is too much wandering around for no apparent reason.  How children can sit through this is beyond me.  For fantasy movies, give me Lord of the Rings.  At least I know there will be something in that one.  And lastly, anybody know why John Cleese got top billing in the credits????\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: I must compliment Chris Columbus. He has done a \"bloody marvelous\" job. The movie fulfills all expectations. There really isn't much more to say. If you have read the book, SEE THE MOVIE. If not, do it anyway. If you don't like this movie then your sense of imagination myst be terribly disturbed. You are probably a little grey man who goes to work in grey suit and spend all day complaining about almost everything. Wait there is a word for such a person. MUGGLER!!!!!\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: My family and I are all BIG Harry Potter fans -- we have read the books and listened to the audio adaptations by Jim Dale all many times. Prior to going to the see the movie we were very curious how they were going to put the all of the \"Sorcerer's Stone\" into a two-hour film, there is so much there. Well, the bad news is that the film makers did not put all of the story into the movie; the good news is that they did an excellent job crafting the two and a half hour movie!\n",
            "Rating: 9, Review: I had extremely high expectations for this movie, and it met almost all of them. The only thing that slightly marred this otherwise excellent adaption was the absence of the potion challenge in the final sequence, and it dropped my rating from 10 to 9, since I felt it was one of Hermione's defining moments. However, the rest of the movie was spectacular - superb acting (Rickman, Smith, Coltrane - too many to mention, really), good pacing in the direction. But the main thing that struck me, an avid reader of Rowling, is that everything looked RIGHT - never once did I see something in the movie that conflicted with how I imagined the book. For this, Columbus and crew should be greatly commended. I cannot wait until the Chamber of Secrets.\n",
            "Rating: 7, Review: Making a full-size book into a film is a huge challenge. When that book is as well-known and action-packed as Harry Potter et al, the challenge looks well-nigh impossible, and so my expectations for this film started out low. Then the reviews started to come in, along with claims that the film was miraculously not bad at all. My expectations shot up again. Foolish...\n",

            "Rating: 10, Review: This adaption of J.K. Rowlings wonderful book Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone was easily one of the best book-to-movie adaptions I have ever seen.  Chris Columbus masterfully was able to retain the feel and emotion of the book, as well as evoke the power and majesty the book wrought, while remaining fresh and exciting, not just a stale by-the-numbers account of what the book said.\n",
            "Rating: 5, Review: I am a father of two boys ages 5 & 6.  We were all excited about seeing this movie.  The reviews are incredible.  I have yet to find a media outlet that did not just LOVE this move.  We were ready to be transported into the world of Harry Potter.  This movie must be like two and a half hours long.  The boys were squirming and asking to leave.  For me there just was no big payoff.  The CGI's looked like CGI's.  The movie moved at a very slow pace. I was waiting for that moment when I would be drawn in. It never happened. The acting seemed to be fine.  It is a nice picture to look at.  The brooms were cool, but There in no reason to see this movie in a theater.  There has been a drought of good movies, but this film is no oasis, it is more like finding an 8 oz. bottle of tap.\n",
            "Rating: 4, Review: To evaluate the movie adaptations of books, I try to see the movie as a standalone object, and try to evaluate how the movie works for someone who did not read the underlying book. And as a person who did not read any of the Harry Potter books, I believe I am in the position to make this evaluation objectively. I can say that for the first movie of Harry Potter Series, this way of thinking signals a huge failure. The movie just assumes that you know all of the significant background information about this universe. Everything just... happens, you do not understand how, and no one cares to tell. No one is surprised of any magical stuff going on.\n",
            "Rating: 7, Review: \"The New Wizard of Oz' of its time. A complete triumph\" -Richard Roeper \n",
            "Rating: , Review: Having not read any of the books, or previously seen the film at the cinema, the wonderous world of Harry Potter was a real revelation. For those that don't know Harry is an orphaned child destined, once removed from the horrible life forced on him by his aunt and uncle, to become a great wizard. But first he must get through Sorcery School. Director Chris Columbus (Home Alone, Mrs Doubtfire) hasn't gone overboard with his scene setting, but has used his imagination to great effect, bringing beautifully to life the scenes at Hogwarts School. At various times Columbus has delved into Charlie and The Chocolate Factory, Willow, Star Wars and even the Indiana Jones series of films for inspiration. Young shooting star Daniel Radcliffe fits the persona of Harry perfectly and seems to have an understanding of the importance of getting his role right. If Harry weren't perfect, the film would've been a disappointment for the many fans of JK Rowling's adventure. Even his young sidekicks, the wonderfully expressive Rupert Grint, as Ron Weasley, and Emma Watson (a young Britney Spears lookalike), as Hermione Granger, are great. The best performances are reserved for the adults, in particular Robbie Coltrane, who plays Hagrid, and veteran Richard Harris, who stars as the revered Albus Dumbledore, while Alan Rickman as Professor Snape is, as usual, the perfect villain. It's easy to get lost in the world of Hogwarts where stairs change direction at the drop of the hat, ghosts walk through the halls and trolls spell trouble. The movie was a little long and many scenes could have been cut, but to do so may have rendered some damage to the fabric of Rowling's rich tale. What Harry Potter is, is a magnificent children's tale that also enraptures older audiences, leaving them spellbound as the story washes over them. While there's nothing particularly new about the direction of the movie and it certainly isn't flawless, it will remain a classic - even if it is only because Harry Potter popularised reading among young people again. Weekly rental tip: Willow (1998) starring Val Kilmer, Joanne Whalley and Warwick Davis. A reluctant dwarf protects a special baby from an evil queen.\n",
            "Rating: , Review: When I went to see this movie, no one was in the theater. I was literally the only one there. After feeling depressed upon realizing I had no friends or life, I started becoming consumed with the film. Was I the only one confused by that so-called Quidditch match? I mean, what kind of ridiculous game is that anyway. If I had been playing that game, I would have simply cast some sort of death spell on the other team, and then laughed a lot, while Alan Rickman and I talked about Die Hard (a far superior film in every way.) \n",
            "Rating: 1, Review: While I am extremely bothered by the mass hysteria surrounding the Harry Potter franchise I will comment only on the film and book.  When reading the book I found it to be highly enjoyable, above average children's literature. The film however,is below average filth that is making more money than it should and therefore telling Hollywood it's okay to put out an inferior product like this.  The great adult actors couldn't even save this movie from bad directing.  Suffice it to say that after I awoke for the second time during the movie (having fallen asleep twice) I realized that if I had not previously read the novel I wouldn't have the slightest idea as to why things were happening the way they were.  In the end Chris Columbus takes a slightly above average book and makes a movie that, if called mediocre, would be receiving excessive praise.\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint are incredibly talented.

This is my new favorite movie.\n",
            "Rating: 1, Review: This is one of the most awful movies ever made. It is so satanic in that there is so much witchcraft and evil stuff. Most people think theres nothing wrong with a movie like this because its fictional. Its not though the characters are fictional but the things they are doing are not fictional. People everywhere think they are witches and they can cast spells on you. All this movie is doing is encouraging little kids to practice the same stuff to.\n",

            "Rating: 8, Review: Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson are fabulous in the parts of Harry, Ron, and Hermione. Being a huge fan of the books, I can't say that the movie wasn't very faithful to the book, but Hogwarts was a little less exciting in my opinion, and in my imagination, things happened much more mysteriously then this movie. But I was highly delighted by Hagrid in the movie, he was way better than my imagination. Too much motion, far too much motion. 8/10, for fans of the book, go see it, but for people who haven't read the book, don't bother. Read the book instead.\n",
            "Rating: 6, Review: As an adult fan of the Harry Potter series, I was unimpressed by the cinematic version of the story and surprised that so many critics are already calling this uninspired production a classic. I can think of dozens of childrens' movies that are superior to this one including Shrek and Monsters Inc. which are playing at the same time. Compared to a true classic like ET, this Harry Potter movie appears weak even by muggle standards.\n",

All the advertisements for it, the articles about the books and the movie and finally my boss, referring the books to me made me have a closer look at all this. When I started to read the Sorcerer's Stone I was quite amazed. People on the train looked at me, a 25 year old guy reading a childrens book, not stopping to laugh...I was that amused that I decided to stop reading until I saw the movie and I can tell you : This one's a great one. Nice characters : Harry, Hermine, Ron, wonderful effects, good action ( I loved the Wizard's chess match at the end ), some good scary effects packed in a nice story. What else do you want ? This one was definitely one of the better ones in 2001 and is a good appetizer for the sequels to come. The only thing that disturbed me was the Quidditch matches as the effects sometimes looked too cheap, but hey there you get more than 2 hours of good laughs, scary effects and real nice special fx....Will continue reading the book now...\n",

I did finally go to see it today, only because I had a request to make a Harry Potter costume for somebody for Halloween...so I had to check it out. I was also curious to see the \"famous\" Harry Potter...and check out the film that is up against Fellowship of the Ring for an Oscar in Art Direction, Music Score and Costume Design.

            "Rating: 7, Review: Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is really challenging to evaluate on traditional grounds.

Based on these grounds I start the movie at 100.\n",
            "Rating: 7, Review: The first of the Harry Potters movie's and its a good a start. I have seen the first film countless of times and i thought after recently watching it, i shall give it a review.\n",
            "Rating: 8, Review: I am huge fan of the Harry Potter series. On a 5 star scale I would give 6 of the 7 books in the series (all except Goblet) 5 stars. And when it comes to rating this movie, I would it give it a 10 if I were judging it based strictly on how much I enjoyed it. That said, I think on a 10 star scale the most accurate rating for the movie Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is 8. The movie is reasonably faithful to the book. And some of the decisions about how to transfer the story from book to film worked incredibly well. For example, the opening chapter of the book is a chapter of crucial importance. But this scene could not be allowed to drag on for 15-20 minutes in the film. A balance had to be struck between respecting the importance of this chapter and condensing it for time and space. The film struck this balance masterfully by eliminating Uncle Vernon's day and only showing Harry's arrival scene. Since that \"day\" was really more Uncle Vernon's story than Harry's it was able to be cut without doing any damage and what's left focuses on Harry's story as it should. Plus, cinematically, it worked well to have that whole opening scene set at night. This kind of good decision making was present throughout most of the book to movie transition. The only real flaw is that the main version of the film omits the scene where Harry finds Flammel on the back of the chocolate frog card before Hermione goes to retrieve the book. Hermione going to retrieve the book makes far more sense of the scene of Harry finding Flammel on the chocolate frog card before that is included. This is a deleted scene but it should have been in the main movie. Overall the book is reasonable faithful to the book. The casting is bloody brilliant. Robbie Coltraine and Alan Rickman were PERFECT for the roles of Hagrid and Snape. You can almost feel Hagrid's warmth through the screen when you watch this movie. As you expect, Richard Harris was a great Dumbledore, wonderfully capturing the grandfatherly mentor from the books. It's a shame he didn't live long enough to complete the series because he was so awesome in the role. Daniel and Emma do show some noviceness in this movie but their subsequent performances in the later films proved the casting correct. The special effects and visuals were mixed in this film and are by far the weakest in the series. On one hand, the filmmakers did a fantastic job bringing things like Qudditch, the Great Hall, and the Hogwarts Express to life. On the other hand some of the CGI was too cartoonish. Fluffy isn't scary at all and the troll is downright comical. The best part of the filmmaking was John Williams score. John Williams should have won the Academy Award for Best Original Score for this movie. This is some of the best music I've ever heard. And it's so identifiable. You here this and it instantly puts you in mind of Harry Potter. And the pacing is outstanding. Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is an engaging and engrossing movie from start to finish and has very few slow moments. And as the most charming, innocent, and light hearted film in the series, this movie is great for kids. \n",
            "Rating: 5, Review: I watched Harry Potter And The Philosopher's Stone on Sky not expecting too much from it. However, it was far worse than the low expectations I had set out for it. As someone who hasn't read the book(s) I thought I was in a good position to review the film for what it is, a film. However, if you haven't read the book you are unlikely to understand much of what is going on.\n",
            "Rating: 7, Review: For me, the book was all about Harry overcoming his self doubt, which is a struggle that we all can identify with. The movie was faithful to the narrative, but it left out Harry's struggle with self doubt. That's like doing Gone with the Wind without the Civil War. I can see why kids loved it, but with a little effort, it could have been so much better. Still, I loved seeing Diagon Alley and Hogwarts brought to life, and the actors were all terrific. So in spite of the watered-down story, the child in me was very happy. But the adult in me (45 yrs) hopes the next ones will be better.\n",

Don't get me wrong, it's a great movie but it only really touches on the surface of J.K. Rowling's world. It's clear that what has happened here is that Chris Columbus has made a film that's true to the book... then realised it's too long and cut out all the unnecessary bits. What's left is a somewhat bitty and shallow version of the story with little of the richness and colour that made The Philosopher's Stone such a standout book.\n",
            "Rating: 8, Review: This movie was awesome but was disappointing to see some areas of the novel not in the film.  I realize that there are guidelines on how long films can be but I'm sure there were ways to adjust the film and have most of the book's events in the film.\n",
            "Rating: 7, Review: I saw Harry Potter and the Sorceror's Stone last night with a friend of mine. It is the first time that I have seen a Harry Potter film. The movie is highly entertaining and enthralling. Richard Harris, as the old wizard, is the movie's Yoda and, in fact, there are many similarities between this movie and the original Star Wars trilogy. Spiritually superior kid Harry (Luke Skywalker) is sent to live with foster parents until he receives his calling to study wizardry (the force) and make his way as a powerhouse in the world (or galaxy.) The movie's weak spot is it's acting among the three main children. Harry is a super mature young person, scary for someone who's really just a kid and should be acting like one. His buddy, Weasely, is in the film as comic relief and no doubt received one acting command \"Look scared.\" This he does often and well. The little girl (sorry don't remember her name and can't back arrow) is as cute as she can be but isn't a tremendously talented actress at this point in her young life. The backbone of the movie is it's delightful old guard. Maggie Smith, as delightful as ever, plays a witch/professor. Her presence and her voice are still absolute magic (important for a film about magic!) Robbie Coltrane is a great big teddy bear and he creeps into our hearts. John Cleese is a perfect casting move as Nearly Headless Nick, the almost headless ghost that hangs around the Hogwarts school. Alan Rickman is absolutely stone cold cool as the dark Professor Snape. He is so darn rigid that he talks almost without talking. There are tremendous little details in the movie, such as images in old paintings coming to life, that make the movie rich and absolute fun to look at. The plot is decent, although it's not very tight and there are reaches and lots of guesses (most of them correct) along the way when we think, \"How could they know that?\", etc. The movie is also delightfully (the last time I'll use the word delightful) English, told in a lighthearted and intellectual fashion. Fun entertainment, not for adults to watch more than once but new young viewers will (and have) eat it up.\n",

            "Rating: 1, Review: This movie was completely boring, and dull. You can cut out the whole middle and you wouldn't notice. They could have done alot, alot, alot better. When I was watching this movie, I said, \"Screw it, I'm just gonna see LORD OF THE RINGS.\n",
            "Rating: , Review: They say opinions are like hind ends and everyone has one.  Well, here is another hind end opinion.  I went to see the movie on its opening day in America and I just loved it and I am almost 50 yrs old.  I have always been a lover of fantasy and these books were certainly the best fantasy books I have ever read plus I was not in the least disappointed in the movie.  They did an awesome job.  Yes, there were a few changes and omissions here and there, some differences in characterizations and story line but not so much different that it ruined the story.  Over all, very well done. \n",
            "Rating: 4, Review: The movie pretty much ruined the good feeling I got from the book. The first three quarters of the HP was well-acted, well-directed and well-effected (sfx). The remaining fourth took a nose dive into cheap HW gimmicks and cheesy computer effects. The centaur (only one in the movie) looked so unreal and laughable, as did the finale with the two-faced Prof. Quirrel Overall: long, empty, disappointing.\n",

            "Rating: , Review: Nearly everything about this film, and the story it's based on, strikes me as humdrum, formulaic, and uninspired.  It took me awhile to figure out why, especially in an area where the writer had a chance to cut loose and present some truly fantastic characters, themes, and situations--to do something original and profound.  That chance was never taken--the presented conflicts are superficial, the obstacles ankle high, the outcome never in doubt.\n",

Everything was perfect -- the acting, the story, the special effects.  You care about the characters and feel everything they feel.  Not to give too much away, but I really felt like cheering during the scene where the house cup was awarded.  A superior fantasy movie and I would recommend it for kids of all ages (8 - 80).\n",
            "Rating: 7, Review: The wonderful thing about a book is that you can sit down and linger over all your favorite parts of it. When I was not too much younger, I'd re-read my favorite scenes of children's books I loved over and over, savouring them. Here, it's all rushed. Sure, it's Harry Potter's greatest hits in complelation format, but I felt stunned, rushed and at the same time bored during the film. I wasn't awed. I wasn't thrilled. Except for a few brief moments, I generally sat there keeping up to pace and wondering how they'd do the scary scenes. (Those, and the Quiddich match, were wonderful and real movie savers) It's a nice little film, and perhaps if I was 14 or so I'd want to see it again, which is of course the point. But not now.\n",
            "Rating: , Review: Let me start off by saying that it is a very hard thing to translate a book into a film format. It can be a huge success or a great failure. It is also made alot more difficult when the book in question has an absolutely phenomenal fanbase. Harry Potter has this, hence any director who was gonna tackle this task, had his or her work seriously cut out for them.\n",
            "Rating: 8, Review: This movie may not be the most exciting in the series, we are still a few away from my favorite, but I think this is by far the best done movie out of the four done so far. The thing that makes this movie so endearing is that there is the magic found in the books, the magic when Harry first found out he was a wizard and the excitement of a whole new world. The children are adorable, and Hogwarts and the wizarding world are depicted beautifully. The music also fits Harry Potter perfectly.\n",
            "Rating: 6, Review: I am a fan of the books but at first i didn't think the movie would be very good but after i watched the movie I thought it was good. The quidditch match was pretty cool. Hagrid's \"I shouldn't have told you that\" was funny. Even if you don't read the books, you should watch the movie.\n",

            "Rating: , Review: SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERSI have to admit, the parts they left in were faithful, for the most part, and I know it's hard to get everything from the book into a movie.  But I felt they grossly undermined just how bad the Dursleys were to Harry.  Their hatred wasn't really felt,and I think they could have established that better.  In the book, there is a specific moment when there are apologies all around among Ron, Hermione, & Harry and the boys become friends with her.  They failed to resolve Hagrid's dragon problem and made no mention of the properties of each house(except, Slytherin, of course--'all the great ones come from Slytherin!\").  Not to mention all the wands Harry went through before he finally found his, and the potions trial in the dungeon as they're getting the Sorceror's stone(proving logic has merit, too.  That scene would also explain Dumbledore's comment about Hermione remaining cool under pressure-it's a nice pun, as they have to pass through fire). But like I said, you can't include everything!  The dialogue was right out of the book and the FX were nice, if a little obvious in places(btw, they could learn something from \"Hercules\" about making centaurs).  All in all, a good movie and a nice lesson about how sometimes, underdogs are destined for great things!\n",
            "Rating: 7, Review: I'd only just finished reading the book when the movie came out and i must say i was impressed.The storyline was well put together so it was made very true to the book.Special effects were exceptional,especially the Quiditch match.Also loved the inventive magic spells used in the story but i suppose JKR is the one to thank for that.Actingwise,Robbie Coltraine was good as Hagrid as was Maggie Smith as Professor McGonagall.Didn't like Richard Harris though.I wish they put Michael Gambon as Dumbledore earlier.The giant chess game was clever as were the flying keys.No wonder this movie was popular because when i went to see it,we were lucky to get a seat because the line up went out the door and down the street.Great movie and a thumbs up for the whole family.\n",

            "Rating: 10, Review: Now, when I first saw this movie, I didn't read the book despite the pushing and prodding of my fellow peers. But, I really enjoyed this movie. So much so,that I actually read the book. Anyways, the things I enjoyed the most in this movie was how despite how bookish it looked I could still feel the feelings that the characters or actors were feelings. Another thing was,as all kids do, was the dialogue. I will always have the phrases \"pertificus totalus\", \" Now if I could remember what I have forgotten\", and \"how can you be nearly headless\" engraved in my own mind forever. I also enjoyed parts like with Professor Quirrell and meeting Harry or the ending with Voldemort. There was a huge intensity that could not be denied. I also loved Sorting Hat and Norbert, the baby dragon. The Sorting Hat was awesome with the deep and knowledgeable voice. And I have always had a deep tenderness for any reptile. Anyways, All I can says this was an magical triumph for Chris Columbus and J.K. Columbus. And thank you to the both from me for the best book made into a movie film I've ever seen.\n",

One little thing though: In the movie scene which Professor McGonagall goes to fetch Wood, captain of the Gryffindor Quidditch team, and tells him that she had found him a new seeker, Harry (after seeing him flying through the air, retrieving Neville's Remembrall that Malfoy threw into the air), the classroon Professor McGonagall enterred was the Defense Against the Dark Arts classroom, according to the book. But in the movie, the teacher was Professor Quirrell. In the book, it was Professor Flitwick teaching. Just thought I'd clear that up. Other than that, great book and great movie.\n",

I came away surprised that it was as good as it was.\n",
            "Rating: 8, Review: The movie is a candy for the eyes. It gets many great special effects. For example, the special effects for the \"game\" are well made. The first half of the movie is interesting and is moving fast enough to keep me excited. However, the second half of the movie is moving much slower. Most of the scenes between the \"game\" and the seeking of \"sorcerer's stone\" can be made shorter. The actors and actresses are well casted and I certainly will recommend this movie to anyone.\n",
            "Rating: 7, Review: Somehow, I had missed joining in on the phenomenon that was HARRY POTTER. I had not read any of the books and missed most of the hype preceding the film. In fact, I hadn't even seen the trailer. So it was with the healthy anticipation that I generally have for the movies I choose to see that I bought my ticket and entered the cinema where I would be transported into a world that returned me to the fantasies of my childhood. I have since read the books and come to understand some of the gripes of the many purists who have lamented some of the changes in the film. But despite some of these (fully justified) complaints, this film will see me return for several further viewings. \n",
            "Rating: 1, Review: I can't believe I waited in line for half an hour to see this. As a film student I take this as an insult to the industry. The child actors are terrible (especially the over-acting hermoine), the story could have been adapted for film (not just taken straight from the book) and the for such a big budget movie the special effects were terrible. But what's worst about the film is the fact that it has attracted so many adults. You know something is wrong with the world when adults are discussing quittich instead of any number of slightly intelligent topics. Still it is a children's film, not a work of art and at the end of the day the kids will be rushing in a mindless throng to see the next film. The filmmaker's have compromised the integrity of the industry in favour of stealing children's money (or at least their parent's money). And to think the world has to endure six more potter outings. Personally I'm waiting for \"HARRY POTTER and the SPANISH INQUISITION\".\n",

I was impressed by the clarity of the plot and the nearly perfect scenery that was breathtaking and exactly what the movie called for.  One of the high points of the film is the wonderful Hermione Granger, the teachers pet and the makings of an outstanding wizard, she appealed to me more so than any other character. Not that the other actors weren't perfect choices, but she seemed to be the ideal child to embody Rowlings character.  Overall I was impressed and dazzled by the entire film, I found myself laughing and clapping my hands with glee as the English train station became platform 9 3/4.  Even people who haven't read the book will find themselves wishing for just one day at the magical children before them.  The fantasy and the excitement of it all is tangible and desirable for all movie viewers.  I would recommend this film to anybody.\n",
            "Rating: 9, Review: I have been a fan of these books for a long time, and though I was a little apprehensive about the movie, I have to say that it was one of the most entertaining cinematic experiences I have had in a long while.  Everything was perfect.  I was a little disappointed in some of the cuts, but that is to be expected when making a movie from a book.  Visually, I couldn't be much happier (and I am a visual person).  The sets, costumes, actors, and lighting were all beautiful, all that I expected them to be.  My only real concern is that the books of Harry Potter were such a wonderful stimulus for lots of kids to read.  I hope that the movie doesn't change that.\n",
            "Rating: 9, Review: After having just seen \"Lord of the Rings\", my judgement was clouded in the wake of the awesomeness of the special effects of the Tolkien story. I couldn't help but compare the two, but Harry Potter was fun, even though I found the young actor VERY wooden. Why did the director tolerate the soulless smiling and lifeless eyes from young Daniel?  It's as if they were looking for that exact factor in the title role. He seemed like he was totally intimidated by the project he was involved with. He started to warm up toward the end, and unlike most films, Harry Potter got better as it rolled along. The most touching scene was the one where Harry sees his parents in the mirror and the chess game was mind-blowing. All the other actors were terrific, and I love the great English actors on hand, Richard Harris, Maggie Smith, and my favorite of all time Alan Rickman!!\n",
            "Rating: 8, Review: Let the magic begin.  That is the tagline to Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone.  The tagline is, for once, perfectly fitting.  Harry Potter is a 152-minute coming of age epic, and entails your basic good versus evil theme.  The script is penned by Steven Kloves, based upon the novel by J. K. Rowling.  Kloves other accomplishments include the Fabulous Baker Boys, and last years wonderful picture Wonder Boys.  Director Chris Columbus is certainly not a new face to the Hollywood scene, but is not that well known. Columbus has Home Alone, Ms. Doubtfire, and Step Mom under his belt, so do not expect a poor effort.  Harry Potter also brings newcomer Daniel Radcliffe to the title role.  He previously had a minor role in the TV movie David Copperfield, and was also in The Tailor of Panama.  While not an experienced actor, Radcliffe is so young and unaware of the entire Hollywood scene, that he delivers charm, and charisma beyond his years.\n",

            "Rating: 5, Review: I went to see this movie thinking that it would be appropriate for adults; I had seen many friends reading the novel, they seemed to enjoy it at any age. I was damn wrong... This is definitely a movie for children. It is pretty nicely filmed, though I think you can reach much higher levels of oniric poetry without so many special effects (like Paul Grimault & Jacques Prévert's \"Le roi et l'oiseau\"). But it does treat the audience like a bunch of kids no older than 11. Where is all the satiric tone I was told was abundant in the book? Is it really the best way to raise children, keeping them in a naive Disney-like \"gnan-gnan\" world? The cast is pretty good, I liked the animated portraits on the walls in the background (This is poetry that touches both adults and kids...). But overall it is far below what I was supposed to expect. 5/10.\n",

            "Rating: 7, Review: I have read all four of the Harry Potter books, and was very excited about seeing the movie, and for the most part, was not disapointed. I found it to be very fast going and completely entertaining. The acting was remarkable. All the kids looked just like they should of, and had the acting skills to match their looks. I only found a better child  actor in Haley Joel Osment. The other actors also did an excellant job, most notibly Maggie Smith, Richard Harris and Alan Rickman. Minus a few details, the movie was very close to the book...For what was there. They skipped a LOT os scenes, which is excusable, I mean, it was nearly 3 hrs as it was. One of my biggest complaints was the Visual Effects. When ever they made a character or creature completely out of Special Effects it looked horribly fake. The Ogre, Cenatour, Fluffy, Nobert, Voldermort all looked horrible. The Scorpion king form The Mummy Returns looked better then they did. I supose they weren't so bad, but after seeing Final Fantasy and movies like that, I can't help thinking of how much better they could of done them. But not all of the effects looked horrible, in fact some were spectacular, like Quidditch. It was so well done, it made me smile with gratification while watching it. The special effects, the choreography, everything was perfect. I was also very impressed by Hogwarts. The art design and special effects were stunning, esspecially when the paintings moved, very well done. I was also highly impressed by the camera work and directing of the film. The way they captured the exploding stone of the chess pieces was fantastic. Overall, very good, I just wished they put more time and energy into the special effects made creatures, but besides that, excellant.\n",

I would like to review this from the perspective of what I saw it do to my generation. I am from the Potter generation, a group that was taught the moral codes of wizardry, spells and Gnostic magic.

            "Rating: 9, Review: First, as the title to this review indicates, I, unlike so many of the teeming masses that went to see this movie opening weekend, have not read the J.K. Rowling books so other than the tidbits I had picked up from my wife, I had no clue what to expect other than long lines. But my wife would have killed me if we hadn't gone. Well in fact, I thoroughly enjoyed myself. I had a hundred questions for my wife about the books afterward and will likely now find some time to read the books so I can see how it compares. I found the world J.K. Rowling created to be quite charming and full of a life of its own. Hogwarts was nothing short of stunning in its concept and rendering. Kudos to the actors too...Alan Rickman was FANTASTIC (but then he usually is) and the child actors were well chosen and very likeable. Daniel Radcliffe was a tad shallow of emotion as Harry, but not nearly so much as I was lead to believe by the critics. In short, if you have any doubts, go see this movie. You won't be disappointed even if you aren't a rabid fan of the books.\n",

They all enjoyed the film, but had different opinions.  The 17-year-old thought it was missing something and hoped that people would read the books before seeing the film.  Her creative vision differed from Columbus.  The 7-year-old was glued to the screen and didn't utter a word, the 44-year-old was enjoying watching the girls react and found it amusing.  I enjoy Chris Columbus' films, but this one seemed to be lacking finesse.  Though the story was told well it just didn't feel quite right.  Then again, evil vs. good, witches, and trolls what more could a girl want on a Saturday afternoon.\n",

Insightful writing, dry wit, spine-tingling action, heart-tugging emotion, and fantasy action fill the story; naturally the anticipation for the movie matched the reader's love for J.K. Rowling's masterpiece about a boy who attends wizardry school.\n",
            "Rating: , Review: Having just walked out of \"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\", this reviewer is still reeling from the experience.  Who would have thought Chris Columbus had another masterpiece left in him after \"Adventures in Babysitting\"?  Columbus proves that his breakthrough was no fluke, and that he can indeed helm such a highly anticipated fantasy film without fail. Despite terrific performance from the fat guy in \"Naked Gun 2\" and Peter O'Toole's drunken sidekick, however, \"Potter\" feels somewhat incomplete. What it needed was a cameo from Michael Gross of \"Family Ties\".  Gross was born to play the janitor of the Hogwarts institute, but the lack of originality on Columbus's part prevented this from happening.  Instead, he relies on the talents of John Lennon in the title role (the bespeckled one hasn't acted in over thirty years, so Columbus's choice here is rather puzzling).  Nonetheless, a great effort by all involved.\n",
            "Rating: 9, Review: Chris Columbus gets the series off to a solid start and stays fairly true to Jo's vision. No, the acting isn't the most spectacular from the kids, but I don't think it's as horrible as some have made it out to be. They are young and over the course of the movies we will get to watch all these young actors grow in skills and physically. The movie is fun and well paced.\n",
            "Rating: 6, Review: The movie faced some incredible challenges  because of the big number of long-time fans who wanted a direct translation.

They tried to compensate the bad acting in this Disney type movie with great special effects. I really look forward to Lord of the Rings since then I can finally forget this movie. The only reason it was a box-office hit was becuase of the extreme hype about the movie.\n",

            "Rating: 8, Review: The movie was very interesting, and before I watched it, I thought it was too exaggerated, but I later learned that the novel is basically long, so there is no lengthening of the events, then it was shown on Netflix today and I was happy and prepared the popcorn and watched it, it was wonderful and I never saw mistakes, which I liked more and more is The writer's imagination is very wide, his imagination is the imagination of a child. This is not an insult but rather a praise. The writer's imagination is very wonderful, like the stories my mother used to tell me when I was a child, she was full of very wide imagination and this is really good!! A movie worth watching and it is recommended to watch it with your family or with your child. Thank you very much.\n",
            "Rating: 5, Review: This movie was okay, but the events seemed all squished in together. Too fast. The effects were great. But the movie missed the luster of the book, that part of book 1 that contributed to your not being able to put it down.\n",

If you hate it that much leave your nasty snarky comments to yourself\n",

            "Rating: 9, Review: When I first read the Harry Potter books, I thought, 'this would make a great movie scenario.  The descriptions are very precise and the dialogue sounds like a series of film replicas'.  Well, the movie was actually made, and I must say I liked it.\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: This, even though it was released just 10 years ago, is a classic. I watched this movie so much when I was six I can probably recite the whole movie from memory, but I don't want to waste 2 hours of my life doing that. I've owned this movie on DVD, HDDVD, Blu-Ray, Blu-Ray Deluxe Edition and regular Blu-Ray edition. Today it still is one of my favorites. This and the fifth movie, I think, are the best in the series. I recommend this to anyone who hasn't seen it, even the Christian groups who fear it has satanic messages. Who knows? They might actually like it. This is also the movie that got me into reading the book series (I read the first three books at age six). I also accredit the books for bringing me my high reading level.\n",
            "Rating: 7, Review: This is the one you gotta get through. But YES, it's very good and worth it. It's just that no one ever WANTS to watch this one. We get it. It's good. Now, let's get this train rollin'...\n",
            "Rating: 9, Review: As a Potterhead, I am very happy with the way the film came out. Chris Columbus's view on our favorite wizarding world is incredible. The casting was beyond spot on, my favorites being Maggie Smith and Alan Rickman. Anyone that overly criticizes this movie truly has no taste. Sit down and enjoy a great movie\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: \"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\" is the first film of the popular series about a boy wizard based on the books by J.K. Rowling.

No wonder this series as already become a phenomenon.\n",

            "Rating: 7, Review: It's a brilliant introduction to the world of witchcraft and wizardry, there wasn't an overfill or cliffhanger aftereffect. You can tell it was perfectly measured to be a nibble at the onset of larger events to come but also pieced a full movie.\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: Watched this film when I was only 9 years old.\n",
            "The scene of this film refers mostly to the 80s epic British film about the happening in Mediocre era. The scene is chilling and the action in the film would satisfy most of the audience.\n",
            "The film also succeeded in attracting the audience into the magic world where Hogwarts was located and it also added many magical creatures and special CG effects that can be considered extraordinary at that time. The music composition does also fit the atmosphere of the film and it fits well in every scene that the film produced\n",
            "In conclusion, I will never forgery this legendary film of my childhood and it is the start of the whole Harry Potter magical legends\n",
            "Rating: 7, Review: The main problem with this movie is that it is too long. It is too faithful to the book. The moviemakers seemed reluctant to streamline the plot and pick up the pace. The video I rented recently contained two scenes (after the ending credits) which had been cut from the movie.  Both were good cuts, neither needed to be in the movie.  More scenes should have been cut.\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: My wife read the book over a year ago and told me I would like it. I said, \"Yeah it seems interesting, but it's for little kids\". I therefore saw it in the theatre without reading the book first. I loved every minute of the film, from start to finish. I haven't enjoyed a movie in the theatre that much since Braveheart in '95. Knowing that books are always better than the movie versions, I realized my wife was right and that by falsely \"assuming\" it was only for kids, I cheated myself out of sheer enjoyment for quite some time. I purchased the book a week after watching the movie and upon finishing it, I was thoroughly amazed at how well the screenwriters adapted the story to film. Some people say that too much was left out. I say \"Hogwash\". This was a wonderful story, and the adaptation was as good as it could have been. Most people haven't ever seen a script and therefore don't realize that even a long script is extremely 'abbreviated' compared to a literary narrative. The filmmakers get an A+ on this one or rather, a 10 rating. Also, Thanx J. K. Rowling, for inventing a wonderful world in which people of ALL ages can readily escape.\n",
            "Rating: 9, Review: I took my 7 and 10 year old grandchildren to this movie and we all enjoyed it very much. This is not aimed at any one particular age group. Its entertaining and fun for all. I would think that 7 would be the youngest I would recommend it for. None of us had read any Harry Potter books, so that is not necessary to enjoy this film which stands on its own merits. Highly recommended.\n",
            "Rating: 8, Review: I have not read the books, and I found the movie to be quite good. I had been prepared for a story aimed too much at a viewer half my age, but it was not an issue. (I'd have like a couple of things expanded upon or explained, but mostly \"leaving it to your imagination\" is a good enough excuse.)\n",
            "Rating: 9, Review: Great movie! specially for the kids. Emma Watson does some good acting. The costumes, graphics and sets are really excellent. long movie but not a drag.\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: Is the movie as good as the book, no of course not, but it's a wonderful movie nevertheless. I think only a professional sourpuss would fail to find magic in this film, however I'm willing to forgive professional movie critics for panning it, they're more or less obligated to give a negative review to anything that universally popular. As I said a movie can never be as good as a great book but a great movie can be made from a mediocre book, just look at \"The Godfather\" or \"Gone With The Wind\", that gives me hope that it might just be possible that \"Lord Of The Rings\" will turn out to be a great film.\n",
            "Rating: 7, Review: Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is a fairly adequate piece of film making with some thrilling special effects;  however, it lacks the storytelling ability of the novel.  In fact, this film is proof that the depth of a novel disappears when one attempts to copy the story word-for-word, scene-for-scene. Most films adapted from novels utilize techniques geared toward \"motion picture story-telling\" which is quite different. I did thoroughly enjoy the special witchcraft effects.  I especially liked the fast and furious Quiddich game with its heart-stopping scenes that could make the Kentucky Derby look more like a tiny tots merry-go-round. \n",
            "Rating: 8, Review: It's hard to get away from one of THE hypes of 2001 and having read the book last summer and having liked it quite a bit I decided to go see the movie, although knowing that a film adaptation hardly is of the same standard as the book.\n",
            "Rating: 2, Review: I went to this movie with much expectation, since I am very fond of Fantasy books and movies, and was disappointed, just like I was disappointed from the book.\n",
            "Rating: 7, Review: There have been some truly excellent reviews, so I just wanted to add a few strokes which the previous people might have missed.\n",
            "Rating: 7, Review: I have yet to see part two, OR read any of the books, so that should probably be kept in mind as you read this review. I mainly focus on the acting: The older actors/actresses were grand as ever: Richard Harris (as Headmaster Dumbledore) and Maggie Smith (as Headmistress McGonagall)stand out, though Robbie Coltrane, Fiona Shaw and Alan Rickman (who is enjoyable in nearly every role he's played) do excellent jobs as well. The weak point is the children, most notably the main character, Harry Potter. Daniel Radcliffe seems unable to adequately portray emotions - he seems surprised at a few instances, but that's about the extent of it. I read that Haley Joel Osment was at one point put up as a possible Potter, and though that would've changed the largely British cast makeup, it certainly would've lead to a vastly superior acting job.\n",
            "Rating: 8, Review: This adaption of Harry Potter rocks!  All the actors were terrific in their roles esecially the young man who played Oliver Wood!  Chris Columbus may have been an odd choice for director, but he never let's his more slapstick side show.  Daniel Radcliff as Harry Potter was very exceptional for a chlid actor.  Emily Watson as Hermione Granger was very exagerrated inn her role, but it goes well with the character.  The special effects were phenomanal! I especially enjoyed the fast paced Quidditch match.  The worst done sequence was the giant chess board scene, which was just pieces collapsing over and over again.  Take your children, no, rephrase that, take your WHOLE FAMILY with you to see this terrific movie!  I give it a full 5 out of 5 (excellent)!\n",
            "Rating: , Review: At 24 years old, i am a self-described Harry Potter fanatic.  I easily outwitted just about all the people i played Harry Potter trivia with.  I love the books, I thouroughly enjoyed the movie! It captures the essence and story of the J.K. Rowlings first novel: Harry Potter and the Sourcer's Stone, aka...Philospher's stone, almost to the letter.   Daniel Radcliff (Harry), Rupert Grint (Ron) and Emma Watson (Hermione) play the characters perfectly. They fit the images in my mind precisely as I had pictured them, although I must admit, perhaps I pictured them this way was becauase I saw a photograph of the three actors before reading the books.  Robbie Coltrane (Hagrid), Richard Harris (Dumbledore), Alan Rickman (Snape), Maggie Smith (McGonagall), John Cleese (Nearly Headless Nick), etc all fit their roles perfectly.\n",
            "Rating: 2, Review: I found this film to be insultingly bad.  Yes, it was pretty.  But there was very little to like in it.  The acting (except for Snape) felt stilted, the F/X weren't well polished, and the writing was simply terrible.\n",
            "Rating: 7, Review: I attended a press screening of HPATSS, a week before the general public, in a theatre full of other press and their families. As I left the theatre, I heard lots of rumblings. Mostly positive. Some of which annoyed me enough to write this now... \n",

            "Rating: 10, Review: Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone was a great book, and was also a great movie, 2 hours well spent, in my opinion, the actors and actresses were superb, and I can only hope that the 'Harry Potter and The Chamber of Secrets' does justice to the wonderfully written book when it comes out.\n",
            "Rating: 9, Review: Sure it has its issues but the casting is excellent and the soundtrack is probably one of my all time favorites. I personally think that it does a great job putting my childhood fantasy's on screen. I think that the book version of Hermione is best represented in this film as well. I believe the Harry Potter films truly whisked me off on a great adventure with Harry, Hermione, and Ron.\n",
            "Rating: , Review: I have read the books about 6 times each, and i LOVE them!!  The world of Harry Potter has really been bought to life by JK Rowling.\n",

            "Rating: , Review: I haven't read any Harry Potter books, so I wasn't gambling any great expectations, and a lot of the story was new to me. But who cares? The film is dazzling - production design is the best of it. It's guaranteed to outlive the accuracy police who worry that details may be lost in the adaptation. \n",
            "Rating: 3, Review: This film was way too long, especially for a children's film. The quality of acting was low, however only for the child actors. The cast included well-known names whom I felt could have done a lot better in other films. I was bored after the first hour and was waiting for the film to get onto a point...but it didn't come at all! However, considering my own choice in movies, which is completely different, others with me seemed to enjoy the movie from beginning to end as a magical experience filled with enchantment and adventure.\n",

            "Rating: , Review: I was engaged by the books, intrigued by the advanced ideas that they presented to youngsters and impressed that so many of today's \"politically correct\" parents would allow their children the chance to read something that provided them with a much more 'real world' approach to life than many fantasies. Indeed that seems to be the whole draw of the series (like any of the best, Narnia, Middle Earth or The Princess Bride) they don't shy away from the plausible.\n",

            "For me, the New Year is about Harry Potter movies. Conversely, it is worth reviewing the first few films in the middle of the year, the elated pre-holiday mood returns to me. What was my joy when I found out that the film \"Harry Potter 20 years later: Return to Hogwarts\" was released on January 1, 2022. Such returns seem to be becoming a good tradition, take at least \"Friends\", the main thing is that they convey the spirit of the universe they are returning, and not work on the principle of \"removing stupidity in order to cut more dough\" (yes, yes, I'm talking about the fourth \"Matrix\" and the series \"And just like that\").\n",
            "Rating: 8, Review: This is a story of a shy, regular boy who finds out about his wizarding heritage. There are so many questions to his past and only time can unlock the ongoing mystery. The story will introduce you to giants, dragons, unicorns, and of course wizards. Harry learns of this new world and the secret that an evil wizard may be still alive. I didn't even give the books a second look until I watched this movie. Now I've read all 5!!\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: This film is what ron would say a ruddy treasure , both the book and the film. I love the sense of horror and mystery that intruiges the three young wizards and holds the rest of the franchise together like the core of the earth. Throughout the rest of the book and film series the puzzle gradually pieces together and becomes more speciffice and interesting...\n",
            "Rating: 9, Review: Let me Start by saying that I broke my rule with movies made from books. I read the book first then saw the movie.  Big mistake in the case of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone.  Although the movie was (a well documented) 2 1/2 hours, the script spread the story very thin.\n",

            "Rating: 6, Review: I read the 3 Harry Potter books(maybe 4th, don't remember which came first). After reading the first one, i thought, not bad, the 2nd one sucked, the 3rd was ok. When the movie came, i wasn't hyped about it like everyone was. After much persuasion I watched the movie before it closed in my country. The movie was under average, but not BAD, so i felt that I had kind of wasted 2 hrs or so there. There were many boring scenes, the ending was ok(was it? I forgot. LOL. Fine, not funny.). Daniel Radcliffe was not as good as I thought he would be, and Emma Watson(was it Emily?) sucked. The person playing Ron Weasley sucked too. Overall, it was an average movie to me, i don't understand how it grossed $968m, LOTR was so much better, the movie had a spectacular Quidditch fight, but after a while it got boring. I kinda felt like i wasted $8.\n",
            "Rating: 7, Review: Consider this review for the Harry Potter epic as a whole...\n",
            "Rating: 9, Review: I believe credit should be given where it is deserved. If a person is inspired by someone else's imagination then he/she should own up to it. What are the odds that two separate people will follow the same genre and name the main character with the same first and last name. I don't know what those odds are but I'll bet they're pretty astronomical. The name Harry Potter was the original name of the hero boy in the movie \"Troll\" (1986). The story also involves a fantasy world with a witch, sorceress, wizard, troll forest nymph and magic. Harry even asked if he could be the sorceress's apprentice. Let's be fair, \"Troll\" was probably the inspiration for the Harry Potter books and movies. Because I respect my sister's judgment and she and her daughters speaks so highly of the Harry Potter stories, I'll give it a 9.\n",
            "Rating: 8, Review: Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is a fantastic book and now a fantastic movie. It was pretty much what i expected though i wish at the start they showed more of the dursley's as i have a soft spot for them. The casting was great to Daniel was great as Harry, Ron pretty much matched Ron and Hermione was was pretty good to, and since i knew the movie was coming out i could see robbie coltrane as Hagrid and Richard Harris was stunning as dumble dore. The Movie was very faithful to the book and kept it all together thanks to columbus of course. And the visual effects were pretty good especially for fluffy the three headed dog and the ghosts and things but this was a fantastic movie...and i look forward to the second one.\n",
            "Rating: , Review: I first saw this film when I was eleven I instantly fell in love with it. For me it was the most magical, exciting thing I had ever seen. I instantly felt as if magic was real. I had never read a single Harry Potter book before so the whole thing was totally new to me. But now I have watched it again it doesn't feel the same, I have grown up and the magic has gone. I think the actors they chose where okay. For an 11 year old ,I think Daniel Radcliffe did a superb job of being Harry Potter. I am not to keen on Chris Columbus and I'm glad that some one else is doing the Prisoner of Azkaban. I think the fact that the story was so close to the book was great, I love it when writers really take a good role in turning there books into movies. Even though J.K Rowling didn't write the script she has remained a big part in the making of the Harry Potter movies, which I think is an added bonus. I think the film is enjoyable for all ages but I think child under twelve will benefit the most from it, as the magic is much more real for them.\n",

            "Rating: 7, Review: For a person who doesn't know anything about H. P world and characters and didn't read any of the books, the movie was very good in showing all of that in an easy and coherent way.\n",
            "Rating: 8, Review: It's a wonderful family-friendly movie which I enjoyed watching, it has a great ending as well. Nevertheless, there are many details that are different from the original novel or not mentioned, I hoped that they'd film us but it doesn't change the fact that this movie is an amazing one.\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: This is the best movie i have ever watched. All the characters are very unique and plays a good role in the movie. A lot of scene includes the CG effect and it all looks real and very impressive. The structure of the story is well organized so that main character Harry grew up through many experiences.\n",
            "Rating: 8, Review: Great movie from quite a reasonable book, but why on earth did they have to change the title from \"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone\" to the Sorcerer's Stone. Surely it couldn't be that they felt those in the good old US of A couldn't understand what the correct title meant and had to change the title so it could be understood. It should be noted that there is a fair bit of a difference between a sorcerer and a philosopher so in using the correct title there should not have been any confusion about the meaning of the title. The changing of the title is somewhat akin to the in of putting subtitles in the Crocodile Dundee movie.\n",
            "Rating: , Review: I'm one of the obsessed HP fans, I want to say that the books are much better than the movie even though I've seen the movie on CD that i bought for like hundreds of times but the director cut to many interesting and important parts. For example like Harry's 2nd quidditch game with Prof. Snape as the ref. and they didn't show how Harry took Norbert up to the tower to give it to Charlie and got detention for that. And how Harry gave trouble and made the whole school not wanting to talk to him until he won 2nd quidditch match. I would really love the movie if the director followed exactly like in the books even though if it's for like 10 hours :-P For example, like movies based on stephen king's novel, say, the movie \"IT\" about the clown, it's long aint it? But we have the satisfaction of watching it.\n",
            "Rating: 9, Review: My first impression of this film was the richness of the photography and the flawlessness of the graphic effects.  Other than that, all the characters were perfectly cast, brilliantly acted and the story treated very well. There was very little missing from the book which surprised me greatly.\n",

            "Rating: 10, Review: This movie came out today, November 16th. I've been eagerly anticipating this day, and it's finally arrived. Of course I never thought it would rain this day, me go the see the movie alone, arriving to a long line, have the power cut off three times during the previews, and once during the movie (when Harry is getting on the train). I didn't know I would hear the rain pouring outside, it sounded so beautiful, and it made the movie a lot greater. Nor did I know my truck would get flooded in the parking lot, get my feet soaked trying to get in the truck. But all throughout this, I couldn't get out of my wonderful dream. The Day Harry Potter came out. The first show of the movie in this theater.      Everything in this movie is described very well. None seems to be left behind from the book. Not the most important parts at least. It explains so much, of how things get to where they need to get, and they show good ways of actually getting there. The graphics in this movie are very good. So much love was placed in this film. The acting is superb, the characters so well defined. The twists this film portrays are beautiful. This film deserves the best. Hopefully it'll get nothing less. Such a beautiful magical film. (Literally)\n",
            "Rating: 9, Review: I can't entirely agree with kylopod (kylopod@aol.com) that the movie doesn't completely do the book the justice it needs.  To me, the movie never \"dragged\" at points, but was seamless.  The book on the otherhand was boring for quite a bit of it.  The Quidditch scenario was much more interesting on film than on paper (although I would have liked the speech given by Wood to his team in the film; but certain cuts must be made I guess).\n",
            "Rating: , Review: Everyone was talking about the fight between Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings. I don´t understand really because thay are totally different films, but anyway, Harry Potter is a fun film to enjoy with your five-year old child. Why? The film has a plot that seems to be written by a five-year old, it is not as exciting as the book, as interesting as the book, it seems to me that Hollywood it´s great at destroying every script that touches. Ok, the special effects are fine, it is true, but there is nothing spectacular. You are paying to see some kids talking about things that seem to be the work of a kid who wrote his last dream. Chris Columbus, has also proved to be a conventional director, who uses sentimentalism to entertain and sometimes to guide all the filme. It is no what I had in mind when somebody told me they were going to make a Harry Potter picture.\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: A movie can never replace what we see when read the books. Our imagination will create what we want to see. Everyone's vision of what should be in the movie is different. Overall, I really liked, and enjoyed the movie! Now really, do you think the whole book can actually be filmed into the movie??? NO! But they put enough in to make it enjoyable! A fun movie to see. Ron was awesome!\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: I can't think of all the right words to say how great the movie was done! The most anticipated movie in a long time, does not disappoint. I am not going to pick it apart or look for mistakes. It was a 2 and a half hour movie as it is, they can't fit everything from the book into the movie.

First and foremost, the titling was changed as a result of the book's title being changed in the US because Scholastic thought \"Philosopher's Stone\" would go over the heads of kids or bore them.\n",
            "Rating: 9, Review: This is a film that was made primarily for children and people should remember that, I think it is unfair to say that the acting is poor because I thought all the young actors did very well. It dose not include alot of the book but it unrealistic to expect that it would be exactly the same the film would have been too long therefore not appealing to the young viewer. Overall an enjoyable film\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: To start off, let me just tell you that I am a great fan of J.K. Rowlings' books and they have helped me through many a rough day during the last couple of years. The books are to my believe, in a unique top 10 of books side by side with Tolkien's masterpieces and the new book \"Artemis Fowl\" by Eion Colfer.\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: Being a big fan of the Harry Potter books, I was very excited when I first heard they were making a movie a little over a year ago. Failing to be able to get tickets on opening night, I saw it the next night, and preceded to see it 2 more times. Let me just say, if you loved the books, you'll love the movie! Even if you haven't read the books, you'll most likely love the experience that is Harry Potter. Though lacking some character development and some satire of the book, Columbus made a wonderful adaption of the already cult classic.\n",

            "Rating: 9, Review: Kudos to the director and screenwriters for making the movie reflect what I loved about the book. It was exactly the Hogwarts I had pictured when reading it, with all of the mystery and fun that I could have hoped for. The casting was also excellently done, and I just adore Maggie Smith! She is excellently portrayed and one of my favorite characters. \n",
            "Rating: 5, Review: The film focuses heavily on Potter's methods of survival and his noticeably deteriorating psyche. When he is not preoccupied with seeking basic necessities, Potter works in his basement lab attempting to develop his magical skills. Radcliff does a superb job of portraying Harry Potter's solitary character, who everyday is searching for solutions to the problems in his future as well as the future of mankind. Radcliffe's acting is the highlight of the film and is really the driving force that could have actually made this film legendary.\n",
            "Rating: 8, Review: I am 19 years old, and have read the first two books in the Harry Potter series. The books are great and I can understand all the hype. I was looking forward to this movie, but seeing the trailer gave me the impression it wouldn't be great. In watching the movie two nights ago at the staff preview and again last night I just thought the movie felt too rushed. It tried to include everything in Rowling's book which didn't capture all the plots in the story and in fact ruined some. The movie lost lots of the humor and emotion found in the book. Also, my friends who hadn't read the books were confused in a few parts since the plot had holes. They didn't even see Potter as being this great wizard. The movie was definitely written for people who had read the books. I would give this movie 2 1/2 stars out of 4. On a further note, being a young adult/late teenager, I can understand the appeal this movie will have to children 12 and under. They will want to go see it many times, I won't go again. One thing that bothers me about this movie is that it is the current fad, and for deserving reasons, the books are great, however, just like the latest Britney Spears cd, everyone will be running to the theaters to buy their ticket. I realize this movie will probably break the $400 million mark due to repeat viewings by younger children and their parents. Good for Potter, but it saddens me that this movie will do better in the box office than the Lord of the Rings. This bothers me for the Lord of the Rings will be a better movie but I do not think will make as much money due to all the repeat viewings of children and their parents. Both movies are worth seeing. But let's not pretend that Harry Potter is a classic when it's not.\n",

            "Rating: 7, Review: O dear - disappointing. Best features of the film are Hagrid and Hermione: both outstanding. Not too good: Harry is 'flat' (lacking excitement and energy); the cupboard under the stairs looks far too nice (and so it loses the 'escape from reality to fantasy world' point); Hogwarts dining hall is so obviously Gloucester cathedral nave; most of the the humour has been lost; the owls lose their gorgeous imaginative character; the voices seemed dubbed in places; some scenes lacked any obvious point (e.g. the invisibility cloak in the library); the academic year was curtailed. Good, but not great.\n",
            "Rating: 9, Review: I had never read any of the Harry Potter books before watching this movie. My mother read all four, and I always made fun of her. I said it was \"child's play\" (I'm 18). This was one of the most entertaining movies that I have seen in a LONG time. The last few years, there have been too many weak films that you never remember a month later. Harry Potter is one that will stick in my mind for a long time. I have now read all four books, and I'm looking forward to \"Chamber of Secrets\" next fall!!!\n",

The film was clearly made for those who read the book; not that you can't understand the story just by seeing the film (because you can), but those small details that are important to love the story are not there. However we have great actors, great special effects and an amazing soundtrack. What I'm saying is that they had everything to make a much more better film. In a scale of 1 to 10 I give it 6.\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: Based on the first excellent novel by author J.K. Rowling the film is a wonderful success.When orphaned Harry Potter finds out that he is a wizard he starts school at Hogwarts and is befriended by Ron Weasly, and Hermione Granger. But is disliked by jealous enemy Draco Malfoy. The adventure and fantasy runs wild from the Quidditch field to the stunning climax this film is going to be a classic. Played by Daniel Radcliffe Harry Potter is brought to visual life along with smart young actor Rupert Grint who portrays Ron and pretty Emma Watson as the adventerous witch Hermione. This film lacks the glory of the book at times but it flys by with its run time and is directed very elegantly by Chris Columbus film deserves a ten and is wildly waited for its sequels.\n",

Knowing that there is to be more movie's in this series lets me understand that certain parts have to go slow/drawn out to explain background info & other parts later on. So make sure you are in a comfortable chair when watching.\n",
            "Rating: 3, Review: I just don't understand... I CANNOT understand... what is the fuss about? Why in heaven's name did this film receive so much praise? I think that it's scarcely more than a blown-up, clap-bang-whizz production with virtually no intent on telling the story properly as making it look like some mega-fantastic phenomenon of some kind; a chance for the producers to dangle their treasures, their ultimately priceless possessions in the faces of the viewers so that you can't miss the action whatever the situation is. Why else would the likes of certain actors be present in roles that clearly don't suit them (or else they don't suit the roles) as well as they might have done for members of the acting profession who don't specially have notable reputations and acclaim to support their good names (okay, maybe they were of the right SORT to have played the characters, yet in regard to the way they were presented in the books I perceived a lack of performance and instead more of the \"natural\" style of acting; somehow that ruined it for me).\n",
            "Rating: 9, Review: The books about Potter are absolutely great. So, this movie begins with an extreme advantage: a great plot is already written. The disadvantage is that these books are very popular and thereby everyone would compare the movie with the book. To make everyone happy is an almost impossible task and I would say this movie didn´t achieve in that, but.....they get really close. Many plots, characters and little things out of the book are there. The only thing is, that they couldn´t work out all the characters at a deep level. Thereby, you sometimes miss things on the screen you did read. On top of that, I really missed \"Peeves\"; the bully poltergeist. But, John Cleese as \"Sir. Nearly Headless Nick\" was very funny. For me, one of the best parts was the Quidditch game. They really made it look great. Also, the surroundings are great: you really see Hogwarts, Diagon Alley, Privet Drive and Gringots. Especially Gringots, the bank which is run by Goblins looks brilliant. For people who have been reading the first book, watching this movie is a wonderful experience; you see everything come to life. And, at the end of the day, they did really stay close to the book, not changing much. For people who didn´t read it, I think, the movie isn´t really good. I strongly advise to those people to first read the book and watch the movie after that. For me, watching it was a pretty intense experience: I really loved all the books and have much sympathy witch Harry and his friends (and enemies). The actors performances aren´t outstanding, but not bad also. The special effects were sometimes pretty good, sometimes at a medium quality, but also sometimes just not good enough. I mean, don´t expect a quality like Lord of the Rings (LOTR). Last, comparing the Potter movie to LOTR, I dare to say that  LOTR wins every imaginable contest with the Potter movie. But, LOTR is something so special, so perfect and brilliant, that every movie loses it to Frodo and his friends. So, in sum, Potter isn´t by far in the same league as LOTR, but it still is a pretty great movie to watch. I´m already waiting for The Chamber of Secrets....\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: I have enjoyed watching Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone several times so far and enjoy watching it with friends. Each time I watch the movie, Emma Watson is my favorite to watch. I have seen many young stars in my life and I do hope that Emma Watson continues her acting career. She is a diamond in the ruff, that has yet to shine. I wish her all the best in her future acting career. I look forward to seeing if I am correct in my prediction. Emma Watson a name to remember.\n",

Into the first few minutes or so I immediately fell in love with Harry and I have never looked back since.\n",
            "Rating: , Review: Harry Potter and the Sorceror's Stone is the first of seven (maybe eight) books written by the now legendary JK Rowling and the book is masterclass, a league above all other books. From what I've just described above, the expectations were high. And it didn't fail to deliver. It's a great movie with pretty good CGI effects(Troll and 2 heads) and it seems they've picked the right actors for the huge job. I didn't find Daniel Radcliffe very effective, though most other characters played their parts well. Richard Harris(Albus Dumbledore) plays his character with particular finesse and charisma. A shame he died during the film of the third film:(RIP). Tom Felton(Draco Malfoy) has done well some sort of Villain. Overall, a well executed film and supreme acting by the actors and actresses of the future!!!!!!!\n",

            "Rating: 10, Review: What a film! I watched this yesterday after a long hard shift at the fish mongers, I was amazed. It's all about this little bespectacled kid called Harold potter who as luck would have it is a kind of wizard or alien. The lad has special powers that allow him to talk to snakes, slugs, pigs & various rodents, not only is he bilingual he's also rock hard and proves this every chance he gets by scrapping with anyone who so much as looks at him wrong. After finding out about his new skills and Uri Geller like mind Harold boards a train for Hogwarts, a special school for other wizard/aliens. Accompanied by his new mates, a ginger lad & a little lass, Harold foils a terrorist plot and uses his special brain to bring the terrorist to justice. Also involved is the local gardener a big bloke from the Bristol area called Hagrid. Hagrid also has special powers but sadly a less than special brain. Another character who appears frequently is the albino anti Christ Malfoy, who with the help of two goons goes round picking on folk. Harold can also fly, play chess, read, write and is a brave athlete in his spare time. With little or no flaws to his personality Harold potter is a cult figure in London and the south west, we also learn he loves the country side, owls and a hearty breakfast of a morning, all of which are abundant at Hogwarts\n",
            "Rating: 8, Review: I still can remember 2001 and the night I saw this movie for the very first time.\n",
            "I wasn't so educated in the field of world cinema then, but even then I knew that a big thing was coming up with this movie. I was young to understand what a window into the world of magic JKR opened, but it was clear to me that every next film of that genre would be made as some kind of copy of this one.\n",
            "Since Harry Potter was filmed and screened alongside the Lord of the Rings, anyone who loved film-making was privileged to choose their view of magic based on how the two films presented it to the world. I chose the way JKR showed it to the audience with this film. I respected the Lord of the Rings but my imagination and my desire to continue were more on the side of Harry Potter. Today, as an adult person, I can still confirm that I am more a supporter of the magical world of Harry Potter than the Lord of the Rings, but today I understand a lot more things that need to be understood and known in order to adequately characterize and evaluate a film. I will not deal with his comparison with the Lord of the Rings because now I think that these are two films that deserve to be viewed completely separately. The plot of the Harry Potter film is impossible to judge as bad. By showing this world of magic and sorcery, JKR was innovative and the first to give such a thing to our eyes. As the plot cannot be assessed as bad, so the actors in that film cannot be assessed as bad. It was the cream of the acting world that was merged with the then new names that got a chance to become equally famous, and they did. the Costumes, effects and music are surreal and the overall experience of the film is like riding in an unfamiliar world you don't want to get out of. I think that is what made JKR known and loved among the readers and the audience and on the other hand made her continue the story she started. The acting in the film itself is adapted to the youngest viewers but it is so high quality and well integrated with the script that it is interesting to adult viewers as well and I think that is what made this film a classic.\n",
            "I think it is not a mistake that this film got its sequels in later years because the main advantage of this film was to achieve the effect of timeless instead of the highest quality and that is why today we have the never forgotten Harry Potter and his family who will live for years to come. our. I wouldn't take too long with the rating and features. Suffice it to say THANK YOU JKR.\n",

The main character's name is Harry, a mistreated boy who has special ability. He embarks on a adventure to the Hogwarts school. He meets Ron and Hermione, one an adorable mischief maker, the other a very strict and studious young lady. Together, the trio try to set things right in the school and outside the school. The adventure attracts all the audience's attention until the end of the film.\n",

Any way the film started and there was a cheer from the crowd would it be as good as their expectations?\n",
            "Rating: 5, Review: Maggie Smith was wonderful, and Harry very well cast but the movie as a whole was long and slow and lacking in wit. As for all the controversy, most of the content was harmless enough, and some just whimsical, but there were some bits that were emotionally pretty strong (a little boy sacrificing himself for the greater good???) and violent and probably nightmare material. It was a pretty good story but could have been better told. For all the frenetic pace, it did seem to drag.\n",
            "Rating: 9, Review: The one name that seems to be on the whole of the western world's lips is Harry Potter.

I, like crate-loads of others have read the book and waited for the film and I wasn't disappointed.\n",
            "Rating: 9, Review: In my vote for this movie, I gave it a 9 (out of ten).  This was a combination of the first thirty minutes, which were a 10, followed by the remainder of the movie being an eight.  If you've read the book, you'll get chills as the beginning sequences of the movie makes you feel the same way as the book did.  This is true movie magic at its best.  After getting past the introduction and settling into the story, the movie sometimes drags a little, but it will still keep your interest.  Despite the length of the movie, there is still plenty left out.  I'd be curious to hear what someone who hasn't read the book thinks about the movie.\n",
            "Rating: 6, Review: I have to own up that I am no fan of Harry Potter series. I read The Sorcerer's Stone partly because my girlfriend who completes all four HP's recommends them highly and partly out of curiosity. I finished it in two or three days and find it not so good as people said. We can see similar stock characters and typical stories in classics such as Charles Dickens' works and other novels intended for kids: a bereaved child in a hostile environment is recognized as the center of some important events and a respect figure. But this is for kids, and I have no objection for that. This Sunday I took my girlfriend to see the movie she had expected so long, only found it worse than the original book. Many viewers mention that the film omits too many quotes and episodes on the book, however this is not what I object to. When dealing with a literary work, a film director has to decide what to put in the flick and what to leave out; a movie can not include all characters or plots, or audience will be bored, and Warner Bros. will be broke. My opinion is just the opposite to these diehard fans: the director should cut off more irrelevant plots to make this film more tightly organized, like what he did when making Home Alone. Columbus is too concerned about satisfying book fans that he fails to edit the story into a more organic whole; the result is that he deletes the beginning as well as the resolution of many episodes to shorten runtime. But by doing this, he is being unfair to non-readers of HP. I think many moviegoers without prior knowledge of the story will be bewildered by some important scenes. Furthermore, the director doesn't make Harry Potter and other characters more vivid. If the actor doesn't have the extraordinary smile and innocent look, many viewers might lose interest on him. The earlier mirror episode provides an excellent chance to dig deeper inside Harry Potter's psychology and desire, which will make us identify and sympathize more with the boy, but the director doesn't hold on to the chance and let it slip away. We can see many great British actors in this film, all wasted in the flat narrative style. Columbus might cast them out of their appearance, and makeup might be the best thing in this blockbuster. You don't frown when characters show up--they look just the way they are supposed to look. This is an attempt to translate words into images, and that's the only thing Columbus does.\n",
            "Rating: 6, Review: OK, for starters, this movie was fun and entertaining, but mostly due to the special effects and the acting efforts of the veterans (and because of the director, Chris Columbus: \"Home Alone\", anyone?). The story wasn't so trimmed, so I'm grateful to that (maybe because the book wasn't as long as the later ones, mind you), but the one thing that annoyed me most was the acting of the children, especially Rupert Grint and Emma Watson.\n",
            "Rating: 8, Review: Being something of a purist, I was really concerned about hearing that Harry would be coming to the big screen.  At first, I didn't even plan to see the movie, figuring that they would just prostitute something that is destined to be a classic.  I was pleasantly surprised, however, to see that they remained true to the books.  The movie is long, but so well done that you scarcely notice.  Having read the books myself, twice, I watched for any deviations or gross omissions, and found none.  There was a point, at the end, where my twelve year old son came out of his seat and said \"what did they just do?\" when he realized that they had omitted something he expected to see.  (This is a child who's read the books four times, so he was *really* watching for omissions.)  He realized later that the scene he was looking for really wasn't important, and that it may show up later in the DVD.  The casting was well done, and the acting not bad, considering that the kids are all relative newcomers.  (I can't wait to see more of Oliver Wood/Sean Biggerstaff--what eye candy he is!)  After seeing this, I have changed my mindset about Harry going to Hollywood, and now I can't wait for the rest of the series!\n",

Those who love it seem ready to bash other flicks, especially The Phantom Menace, as being not as good, while those who are bashing it bemoan how it rips off too many scenes from the Star Wars films. In addition it seems that the followers of Tolkien (or geeks as many of us, myself included were referred to in high school) are beating up on Harry as the Lord of the Rings movie approaches. \n",

            "Rating: , Review: To me, the movie wasn't all that great. It skipped a lot of parts from the book. I know they couldn't ALL be included due to running time, but a few MAJOR parts were left out, leaving all who have read the book wondering when it's going to happen. Also, some of the acting is bad at the beginning. Dumbeldore and McGonagall weren't that great then. It sounded pretty robotic. The special effects were GREAT, however! It gets brownie points from me on that. It's a great children's movie, but for people like me that really spot out stuff that is wrong, it's a little less than wonderful.\n",
            "Rating: 6, Review: I will start my complaints with this movie in a few very easy to follow statements. This movie has some of the best effects I have seen in a long time. I will admit that on my standpoint, but this leads to its downfall. The acting in this movie is very bad. They at least needed to find an actor who had some sort of talent for playing Harry Potter without basing it on an actor that looks like him. The characters are very undefined and undeveloped. Harry Potter doesn't once question what is happening to him and just lets it happen. He never changes and seems to show very little emotion. The main villain is very undefined and in the end, no one really knows what his deal is and does anyone really care. The movie is very long and very sugar-coated to say the least. The plot is very thin and really sucks much out of the imagination. the plot was something that you could only really enjoy if you read the book. I believe the director and producer was under the assumption that everyone read the book before viewing. This movie is only aimed at little kids and other people who watch this movie realize this too because there is very little they can get out of this movie beside its high budget and effects. In other words, this movie left me cold and unfulfilled.\n",
            "Rating: 8, Review: Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone delivers a fantastic translation from the written page to the screen. This flick is a whopping two and a half hours so it might not be as ideal for the younger audiences as you might expect. Fortunately, it will please the older Harry Potter fans with it's fantastic visual adaptation of Harry's world, and it's length allows it to be extremely faithful to the original story line.\n",

            "Rating: , Review: ...if you're under the age of 15, perhaps.  Whilst I can completely understand why children go crazy over the Harry Potter books and films, as I would have loved them if when I were younger, I cannot comprehend why they appeal to adults.  I'm not saying they're not well-written or imaginative, and I certainly do enjoy films of this theme, but to me the Harry Potter series is written for children and comes across as a film for children, that adults might enjoy, but not think are particularly amazing.\n",
            "Rating: 9, Review: Great Movie! I haven't read any of the harry potter books, but i found the movie very easy to follow.  I first suspected the movie was aimed towards kids, but i also found my enjoyment in this movie.  I have seen it 3 times now in the theaters and plan to buy it on DVD.  I recommend this movie for all ages, i haven't heard anyone i know say bad things about it!\n",
            "Rating: , Review: I am probably expressing the same opinions of thousands world wide, yet I must place my opinion once again... hardly worth watching if the books meant anything to you. This movie is choppy, confusing, and strays in a number of ways from the books. The characters are there (although not convincing) yet none of them capture the spirit of the books...I can only put in a good word for Mr. Alan Rickman as Professor Snape, my favourite actor and the only one in the movie who can actually act...As someone who is a a fanatic for the books, I can only say that there were single lines that would have improved the all over impression of the movie. (Yes I sound crazy, but its true) Voldemort, the evil dark lord who I pictured so creepy (and I was prepared to be scared) made me want to laugh out loud. Perhaps young children will find this entertaining, but I must say I was disappointed.\n",
            "Rating: 9, Review: I had read the books about a thousand times already before the movie came out. The first time I saw Sorcerer's Stone I thought it was great. The second time seeing it was okay... and the third time, I was like, \"What have they done?!\" Well, now I really kind of don't like the movie, but believe me... if you've already seen the movie and didn't like it, the books are MUCH better! I'll still go see the other movies, but they will never live up to the book. The first two movies were rushed and I'm hoping POA will be better since they have a new director. Just read the books at least! And maybe you'll have a different outlook on the world of Harry Potter.\n",
            "Rating: 9, Review: I thought that Chris Colombus did a great job on this movie. It stayed fairly true to the book and was entertaining all the way through! Sure they left out some stuff, but doesn't almost every movie based on a book do that? If you love the books, I guarantee that you will love this movie. Your imagination comes to life right in front of you on screen and it's just amazing to see everything you have been picturing inside your head come to life. Can't wait for the Chamber of Secrets!!!!\n",
            "Rating: 5, Review: Basically, a film about a bestseller such as Harry Potter would have a lot of potential, if it would be directed as careful as the novel. Unfortunately, the narrative techniques of J.K.Rowling are not applied in the movie at all, although this would be quite easy to do.\n",
            "Rating: 8, Review: I took my little brother to see the second movie in this series, was very pleasantly surprised by it (also because it's a great movie to watch with a little kid), and so my family had no trouble getting me out of the house to see this one (which is more than can be said for the books, at least.) This is every bit as good as the second movie and for a blockbuster Hollywood fantasy film I go with it over the recent Lord of the Rings entry. This movie is an improvement in terms of plotting, with some clever mixing of chronology, but a step back in terms of action - the amazing aerial dogfighting of the second movie is unfortunately pared down in this one. But the real winner is again that amazing castle. Forget about the drama and just enjoy being carried through the castle.\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: never has there been a book adaptation so popular or great as Harry Potter. This is one of my all time favorite movies (Alongside the others). Harry Potter is a movie people will look back at for years on end. No matter how much you watch it you will always want to visit it again and again. Some people say that these movies are meant for kids but the further these went on they became more for adults. This one you can watch with you're children all the time. This was based on a children's book, so were the others, but only the first two felt like they were for kids and the others just became more freighting for kids. It's about a kid named Harry Potter who is told by the half giant Haggrid that he is a wizard and go's to Hogwarts school for witchcraft and wizardry. Who friends two kids Hermione Granger and Ron Wesley, who try to defeat the dark wizard Voldemort, who killed Harry's parents when he was young. The ending is a bit dark for kids.\n",

            "Rating: 7, Review: This was an incredibly valiant attempt to bring the books to the big screen, and in my opinion does so beautifully. The story is simply magical and \"Hogwarts\" is a genius invention. The movie is done well, almost perfect. It's the closest to the book they can get and it's an amazing experience for any kid. My only complaints were the child actors, which is understandable and were still young and we now they develop into great actors later on. I think the film's quality doesn't really hold up anymore and the CGI and special effects doesn't really look great. I think it was champagne casting and they really managed to stand up to the might of the books, defying everyone's expectations. It's a really enjoyable movie and especially for kids, is a magical adventure that you can watch over and over again\n",

            "Rating: , Review: Naysayers and those without magic or childish wonder in their souls aren't going to like my thoughts on the \"Harry Potter\" phenomenon. The movie is a brilliant melange of eye-popping wondrous visual effects and the finest British theatrical talent that money can buy. Those who demean and continually whinge on about the film are, IMHO, just jealous over the unparalleled success that Ms. Rowling's creations have enjoyed, the likes of which we haven't seen since a small American film named \"Star Wars\" opened in 1977, and quickly became the stuff of cultural legend. Ms. Rowling's characters and settings spring from the same mixture of folklore, mythology, and clear-cut good vs. evil story-telling as her fellow British writers of generations past, namely J.R.R.Tolkien, C.S. Lewis, and Roald Dahl. They have all managed to slip important lessons about morality, the nature of existence, and why concepts of honor, loyalty, and friendship are vital to the well-being of humanity, all without being heavy-handed or overly treacly in their fervor and desire to instill these values in our children. A finer assemblage of British talent could not be assembled on a single motion picture sound stage: Richard Harris, Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman, Robbie Coltrane, John Hurt, John Cleese, Julie Walters, Zoe Wanamaker. The three young people essaying the lead roles acquitted themselves marvelously and have bright shining futures ahead of them , in whatever industry they choose. If they're smart, they won't take any notice of the mean and spiteful comments made about them by grown-ups who have clearly forgotten the simple joys of childhood. They should contact Jake Lloyd about how mean and cruel grown-ups can be, in terms of performances in a franchise that hard-core fantasy/science-fiction enthusiasts have adopted as a religion. Read the books, enjoy the fabulous and enchanting movie, recapture the excitement and thrill of being transported to a magical and carefree place where the villains can all be identified by their black hats and are easily vanquished by conjuring tricks and the power of witchcraft. If your heart is already black with the diseases of cynicism, jaded indifference, and the mistaken belief that flash cars and cell phones make you special, leave the rest of us to enjoy the dream and curl up in your own.\n",

            "Rating: 6, Review: I had read the series with my daughters twice so the inconsistancies were a distraction.  It wasn't bad, it just wasn't quite right.  There was quite a bit material from the book that was missing from the film. I have my doubts that people who have not read the books will understand all of what is going on in the film.  That aside, I will say that most of the special effects were good, and the casting was acceptable.  But truth be told, I much prefer what my imagination conjured up to what was offered on the screen and I'll be making every effort to read the books again.\n",

            "Rating: 7, Review: I found this film thoroughly enjoyable, and I am led to believe that it stays relatively faithful to the original novel.  Its storyline is extremely well constructed and quite plausible, which in my opinion is a rare occurrence in fantasy movies.\n",
            "Rating: 8, Review: I walked into 'Harry Potter' with as open a mind I could possibly have.

However, thanks to this movie, I am now intent on exploring for myself the wonderful world of 'Harry Potter'. \n",
            "Rating: 9, Review: The hype and the merchandising were always going to add to the cynicism with which some people approached the Harry Potter film itself, as was the overly-reverential preciousness with which certain adults treated the book. (It's excusable in children and young teens, but let's grow up, the rest of us!) So if you set all that aside, you're left with two related questions: does the film capture the essential spirit of the book and is it a successful screenplay it its own right?\n",

            "Rating: 6, Review: I was both anxious and reluctant to see the Harry Potter movie, because it is always tricky to make a movie live up to the level of the book.  With the J. K.

Often I'm worried that a film will not live up to its expectations, and the bar was set rather high for this film. I'm glad to be able to report that this movie has earned its current status and any awards it might receive. The character development went along rather well, and the details shown in the movie were a beauty to behold. The length of the movie might prove to lose the interests of the very young, but all the adolescents in the theater with me were deeply involved in the movie - another great thing to see! I've rated this movie a perfect 10, eagerly await the next film, and can't wait til I get my hands on one of the novels! Thanks for such a wonderful film!\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: I've been anticipating this film for more than a year, and finally I saw it last night, at 10PM. I've read all four books several times, the first one the most, and I just can't get enough of Hogwarts. When I saw the film I was a thinking about how the sped through the beginning, and cut out a lot of dialouge.      At Hogwarts I thought they could have done more with the school, and the classes to make it more magical, but I thought the special effects were brilliant!! THe Weasley Twins were so funny, although they didn't really have any big lines. Unfortunately they skipped out my favorite part when they say 'We know our names are Gred and Forge'. Hagrid was JUST as I imagined him and I was so pleased. Percy might not have been snooty enough, Hermione was so great, especially in her first seen, Ron was hysterical with all of his sarcastic, witty lines, Harry was magnificent! I must say, Harry Potter must be a hard part to play in a movie because basically the whole book was him thinking, and Daniel Radcliffe had to portray that through his facial expressions. I loved all the teachers, with the exception of Snape, he didn't look anything like a imagined, but he was still good.\n",

            "Rating: 7, Review: This is a movie that I can probably point out numerous flaws with, but it's the type of movie I don't want to because this movie is quite simply, magical, the young actors managed to do a pretty good job mostly because of Columbus' direction, also while Harry isn't that interesting of character he's a great surrogate for the audience.\n",
            "Rating: , Review: I was one of those adults who were very sceptical about the hype around JK Rowling and the saga she had created. I thought it was just another childrens book.

I've read every Harry Potter book available and they get better and better.\n",

            "Rating: , Review: HP did entertain me. It's a faithful adaptation of the images of the book, but nothing else. It just cannot convey much of the emotion of the characters in the book, and in the end, it ends up being just a great disappoinment... why, you may ask? because of the same reason Star Wars EP I:TPM sucked: the use of BAD CGI is stunning! they abused, no, USED an obscene ammount of bad CGI at some key points where it was not needed... and that breaks up the fantasy, disrupts the suspension of disbelief when one could be having a ball. The technical flaws on this one hurt it very deeply, but still it's not a bad movie. It just didn't live up to the hype, and will never reach the level of fun the book series bring. Would've gotten 3 stars out of five, but since I have read the books and have thus something to compare them to it gets measly 2 out of 5.\n",
            "Rating: 9, Review: I think this is a brilliant film! I've just watched \"Harry Potter and the deathly hallows\" and I watched the first one with my nana this morning, I only just realised how much the actors have got better through the series, I've read the whole book series and I thought they were the best books I've ever read! Anyway Back to the film recommendation, Lord Voldemort is quite frightening. His voice is terrifying and I was only 8 when I watched it with my parents, I watched it and was extremely frightened, I couldn't even sleep that night! I would recommend that if you are going to watch it with you're child tell them to close their eyes and ears until the whole bit with Voldemort in it is done, the spirit part is frightening too I would let your child/ children watch after he, Harry has been knocked out.\n",

My 15 year old daughter and my little boy and I finally got to see the movie last night on opening night!  We have been counting the days, and even had my mother camp out to buy tickets during the day while I was at work (she went to the movie with us also). It was everything we hoped for and more!

That's not the worst thing, how can anyone in their right mind like Harry Potter? \"Oh yes he's so cool because he can fly and because he wears black and carries a wand,\", So? That's the same description of Batman! Thing is no one should ever entrust the fate of the world to a kid with a bowl haircut who is as vicious and obviously much stupider than his opponents. It is not realistic that any child like that could defeat a snail. I tell you truthfully, harry potter does and always will suck, if you don't agree, then deluding yourself you are!!! GO HOME AND CRY!\n",
            "Rating: , Review: This film is magical. I had two MAJOR problems. One being that HOGWARTS felt awkward, and Daniel Radcliffe played the part terribly.Yes, he looks the part but he does not have the acting talent. I believe he got the part because he does look quite like HARRY POTTER. The two and a half hours went quickly, but I found Daniel Radcliffe so AWKWARD! This film could have been better ***** out of ********** See it if you can. Also so much money was spent on not so spectacular cgi. I love the book, the film was okay. It has suffered the Hannibal disease; hyped beyond bloody belief, but a dissapointment. I would prefer to go and see The Others.\n",
            "Rating: 6, Review: So there I was looking for another movie to take me to another world, to send shivers down my spine and thrill me to the edge of my seat - with high hopes that young Harry had the ability. Maybe at the ripe old age of thirty I've lost that sense of Wonder that Poppins and Wonka and Chitty gave me as a child but hell, a kid on a broomstick seems so passe these days. Flying nannies and cars and chocolate factory managers were amazing back then! Oh and there was no one as scary as the Childcatcher either.\n",

So go and see it, you have my blessing.\n",

            "Rating: , Review: As a big fan of Harry Potter, I really did enjoy the faithfulness to the original source material. Daniel Radcliffe is, in my opinion, one of the best casting I have ever seen in my life. He is really, and I mean REALLY enjoyable as Harry, and it is really not that hard to like an 11 year old British boy pretending to be a wizard that doesn't even know he is a wizard. But then again, that silly and unrealistic theme in these movies is really what Harry Potter is all about. Rupert Grint and Emma Watson provide outstanding support for Daniel as his best friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger, although Hermione did act a little annoying in the second act. Alan Rickman and Maggie Smith as professors Severus Snape and Minerva McGonagall we're some of the highlights of this film, but when it comes to portraying some of the most important characters in this movie, Robbie Coltrane and Richard Harris stole the show as Rubeus Hagrid and Albus Dumbledore. Although both actors portrayed an amazing Dumbledore, Harris' soft spoken tone is really what made these movies feel lighthearted and fun, as Gambon's serious and dark tone made the last couple of films seem dark and mysterious, as they should be. Although these actors made the movie feel childish and playful and fun, the design of Voldemort really did give me the chills as a child. I couldn't even sleep well for a couple of weeks due to his raspy voice and awful design, in my opinion. A lot of aspects in this movie did make me feel as if this movie wasn't originally meant to be a kids movie, like the portrayal of physical and emotional abuse, the sense of death in this movie, and that one specific scene in the forbidden forest. Overall, this movie is really fun until you get to the horror aspects, but even as an adult, it still is really fun to see Voldemort burning to ash, even as a child.\n",
            "Rating: , Review: The story is classic: A person feels out of place in their own world, but manages to find a new one in which they are something special.  There have been countless takes on the idea throughout the ages, and this one, while arguably not classical literature, is a very delightful story in its own right.  The book is fun to read, for adults as well as kids, and the movie certainly follows suit. Young Harry, orphaned when he was only a toddler, is being cared for by his cruel Aunt and Uncle, and is forced to quietly tolerate the constant bullying of his cousin, Dudley.  On his 11th birthday, however, he gets a present no one could possibly expect: He finds out that there is actually another world- a magical world- right under everyone's noses!  And beyond that, it is there that he truly belongs!  With that simple discovery, Harry goes from being an ordinary young man in an ordinary world to an extraordinary young wizard in a world with no limits.\n",
            "Rating: 7, Review: Well, I would expect more from the most expected movie of the year. But if I start thinking what EXACTLY I would expect, I would hardly find an answer. The technical capabilities of the film-makers allow to create very astonishing and exciting special effects, but when it comes to magic, something even more special has to be done about it. I mean, I didn't really see a lot of magic on the screen - rather the special effects. The magic objects are acting on their own, not by the magic forces. A \"magic\" seen in a circus is more real than that seen in the \"Harry Potter\", most likely because the actors' play and the special effects are filmed separately and then mixed together. Consequently, the actors (mostly children) have to perform \"as if\", i.e. standing in the green room or somewhere and imagining a magic happening next to them and expressing emotions to the void. For me, this is the explanation why the characters are not that \"live\" and made up mostly of the cliches: a wicked guy always grins, a smart girl always manifests her outstanding knowledge, a clumsy boy would always fail to cast the spells. As I didn't read the book, I can't tell if the characters in the book are same flat and stereotypical, but I have an impression that it's the easiness of reading that contributed to the great popularity of the book. And I really doubt about the success of the movie because the flatness of the book would offer one to imagine what is not described, while the flatness of the movie leaves the \"imagination tanks\" in one's mind filled but partly.\n",
            "Rating: 4, Review: I have no idea what all the commotion and talk over this movie is. I started to read the book put I stopped because it was just boring and I was unable to handle it. The movie was even worse because I felt it lacked the book's details but who cares because the kid actors sucked anyway. I bet that if a book was never writte for this movie this would not be as popular as it is. Another reason why I did not like this movie is because fantasy movies are bad. The only one I really enjoyed was \"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.\" Going back to HP. If you like fantasy movies and the book, then you will like the movie. However, if you hate fantasy movies and the book, then do not see this. In my opinion, 4 out of 10.\n",
            "Rating: , Review: I'll admit it; I'm a teenager and have read every one of the \"Harry Potter\" books several times over. I love J.K. Rowling's subtle, sarcastic wit and clever story-telling, which was completely missing from this movie.\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: Even as a child, even now I enjoy reading and watching everything related to Harry Potter. And I really liked this movie too. Both the acting and the atmosphere in the film are so inviting that from the first minutes you are transported to a world where so many exciting fantastic events take place. This part of the fairy tale is different from the previous ones in many ways, but, of course, also pleases all Potter fans.\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: There is one measure that very few movies even qualify for - visceral thrill.  There were several instances during the movie when I felt an emotional feeling that you rarely get with movies, especially as a male. Amongst those rare movies, the sad ones are prevalent and most capable of extracting emotional attachment by the viewer.\n",
            "Rating: 7, Review: Harry Potter's first big screen debut was one of the most waited-for movies besides Episode I. Now that it has come and gone I can safely say that it IS a good movie, not great, but still good. Acting was fair. Being true to Rowling's awesome book was pretty good also. But some people that have never read the book(s) might have a hard time following the movies choppy flow, which is okay at times, but at others it skips parts that should have stayed to help further explain the story, but other than that the movie is very well executed. I mean, how in the world are you going to fit this huge, classic book into a movie? You do have to leave out some of it, or else the movie would be five hours long! Overall: 8 out of 10\n",

            "Rating: , Review: It seems that movie industry has lost its ability to produce such rare children movies that adults can enjoy as well.  I have never read a \"Harry Potter\" novel, nor have my two sons.  We sat down and watched this movie on DVD.  The movie reminded me of my old favorites such as \"Willy Wonka\", \"Dr. Dolittle\", and many others.  My sister is one of those who criticized this film based on the fact that it deals with witchcraft.  I think people like that need to be more open to the fact that this is \"fantasy\" and not one those action movies that the hero is the man with the highest body-count. Many people find fault with any movie.  I see this one will be a classic and its sequels will do as well, if Harry Potter can keep the formula the same (excuse the pun).\n",
            "Rating: , Review: This movie was pretty good. Though it did not have the richness of the book, even left some parts out, its half decent. But I can understand that they couldn't do all of the filming. England laws have a bunch of things that child actors have to do during the day cutting filming time into four short hours. I am disapointed that J.K Rowling hasn't written the fifth book due to the fact that she is helping out a lot at the set.\n",
            "Rating: 9, Review: Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's stone is a wonderful movie. It is set in a world of enchantment such as the Wizard of OZ. A background of Witches and Warlocks and a place where Goblins aren't the friendly kind. A great young and talented cast has been picked for this movie and it tells as the movie goes on and grows in suspense. Brilliant thoughts and effort went into this film and it was fantastic to watch as will the next two, which will only be even better and unmissable. Overall a brilliant movie with comedy and suspense and should be viewed by everyone.\n",

            "Rating: 10, Review: The first in the Harry Potter series of movies does the book series justice by not only staying true to the book core but by capturing the book's magic and heart. Daniel Radcliffe is an excellent choice for the role of Harry. He captures the pale innocents of his character with ease. Rupert Grint and Emma Watson are just as good as Ron and Hermione, Harry's best friends. They capture their characters essence with a natural ease. Richard Harris is perfect as Dumbledore; He brings a strong center of claim to his character and the movie as well.\n",
            "Rating: 8, Review: Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (or the Sorcerer's Stone, if you like) Is a very interesting and well crafted film, based on a best selling book by J. K. Rowling. Although the main cast is basically made of children, acting was good enough, none of them soiling the film. The supporting cast, on the other hand, has some of the most talented actors in Britain (Richard Harris is a great example). It is also worth mention the small role played by John Cleese (ex Monty Python.) Chris Columbus's direction was excellent, and the special effects and art direction were an example to be followed. To add to all that, we have yet another magnificent score by John Williams. The screenplay was very well written, being closer to the book than any other film of the series. All in all, the fans of the book series will always find this film both entertaining and familiar. With very few and understandable differences, it is a very nice adaptation for the screen of J. K. Rowling's best seller.\n",

Not to say Daniel,Rupert and Emma were bad but were just getting started with this hit picture.\n",

            "Rating: 8, Review: Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone (or Philosopher's Stone for the rest of the world) is a good movie for the family. It's got a nice hero vs. villain dynamic to it, as opposed to the new fad of hero vs. himself in most movies today. Who is the villain gets a little mixed up at the end of the film, but it's all explained clearly. The plot line is a little dull, but so is Star Wars's plot, and look how good that movie is.\n",
            "Rating: 5, Review: Like most mega-hyped movies (phantom menace anyone), Harry Potter lacks much of what 'great' movies have. Not to be unneccessarily criticial but this movie will recieve many popular reviews that are just caught up in the wave after Sept. 11 to reaffirm people's confidence in just how nice it is to live today. Even Ebert has reduced himself to giving this film four stars. Lets see.\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: Being an avid reader of books my trips to the cinema often end up in tears where characterisations, plot and often the entire shebang are sacrificed to produce a cinematic epic.

Being one of the many adults I see reading the Harry Potter series of books on their way into work I was excited but also worried about this foray into the world of the big screen.\n",

            "Rating: 10, Review: This movie was truly designed for the fans of Harry Potter.  It remains very faithful to the book, which some would call a problem, but I call a triumph. The whole point of making this movie was to show the fans what they wanted to see.  Critics will line up to say that the movie is terrible because of the 'hype' and because they want to show they are more sophisticated and intelligent than the public when it comes to watching films.  I recommend that everybody go see this movie and make up your own mind.  Personally, I can't wait to see it again.  10/10!!!\n",

It was like watching a TV series with a huge budget and just 5 episodes run one after the other.\n",

            "Rating: , Review: The adaptation of J.K Rowling's first installment of the Harry Potter series is, not to be too trite, magical. The children are wonderful and perfectly cast. Daniel Radcliffe as Harry strikes just the right tone of wonder, Rupert Grint plays the role of sardonic Ron Weasley as though he were born to it and Emma Watson walks a very fine line playing Hermione Granger as somewhere between a total prig and someone you'd want as one of your best friends. Robbie Coltrane makes a fine Hagrid (although when I read the books, I kept picturing Brian Blessed in the role). I would have liked to have seen more of Alan Rickman as Professor Snape, but considering the ground the moviemakers had to cover, I am very impressed with the results. All of the major plot points are covered and there is a bit of foreshadowing of events yet to come. The special effects are fantastic, as is to be expected, but do not get in the way of the story. In particular, the Quidditch match is one of the highlights of this action-filled movie.\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is a wonderful adaptation of the book by JK Rowling. Sorcerer's Stone is a film filled with the basics and never delves too deep into the full world of Harry Potter. Much like the book, the film does what it can to pull you INTO the world of Harry Potter. The rest of the books (and their films) take you on a wondrous ride THROUGH the world. This film is all about firsts: meeting magical adults and kids alike for the first time, encountering magical beasts for the first time, and facing magical peril for the first time. None of this is to suggest, however, that Sorcerer's stone is at all dull. These firsts and basics are enough to provide enjoyment over and over again. The movie never gets old, the laughs never die out and the magic never ceases. The kids are terrific and the adults are perfect, from Dumbledore and Hagird, to Snape and McGonagall. The Dursleys are terrifically awful, as they should be. Sorcerer's Stone is a great start to a great series and it gets better.\n",
            "Rating: , Review: I saw this film at the weekend and I was deeply disappointed by what I saw. I went to the cinema with an open mind, my girlfirend raving about how could the book is but I still didn't expect that much, and it did not deliver.\n",
            "Rating: 6, Review: Harry Potter is a decently done adaption of the Harry Potter books, and it makes a great movie for the kids. But the movie itself is simply not anything more than this. Chris Columbus, who also did Home Alone is a very plain director. His direction in Harry Potter is not surprising different, just very...underwhelmingly normal. I personally need something more in a movie before it really impresses me, and before it deserves such tremedous glorification as Harry Potter seems to be recieving. If this movie wins an Oscar I will really go insane.\n",
            "Rating: 9, Review: The cinematography was *amazing* and I'm not usually one to comment on it. The costuming, sets, and make-up were phenomenal as well.  The snake scene, Quidditch, chess scenes, and moving portraits were just awesome (watch the pictures in the background during the infirmary scene!)\n",
            "Rating: 7, Review: Unfortunately, the film cannot stand alone, without support of the book, and the viewers that did not read the book would find it long, boring, not accentuated. The suspense scenes are not suspenseful enough and the funny scenes are not funny enough. One of the subplots of the book is teaching Neville Longbottom to stand up for himself. The movie skips the moments of Malfoy's bullying Neville and thus the 10 points for Gryffindor in the end don't seem logical. It seems this is the result of poor editing. Some scenes were cut to make the movie shorter without taking into account the following scenes. Definitely, the movie is very politically correct avoiding calling Hermione a witch. That's funny but, unfortunately, this kills one of the funniest episodes in the book.\n",
            "Rating: , Review: This is a much subtler movie...while it might seem episodic...it moves along at a clipping pace.  The actors are marvellous (as others have noted; bouquets to Alan Rickman and Maggie Smith and Hagrid and young 'arry). They had depth -- something not evident in the LOTR characters.  The graphics were great perhaps not as subtle as LOTR.  At least we weren't bombarded with countless (bad) battle scenes.  I disagree with other reviewers who felt this was more childish than LOTR (which I thought brimmed with mawkish sentimentality and posturing).  Those poms can sure act.  And no token females--the females here had a decent role ...\n",

            "Rating: , Review: Clearly the movie was trying to be as faithful to the books as possible, but sacrificed a lot of character development for whiz-bang special effects. There was no built-up empathy with Potter, and not enough developed with the tight bond he forms with Ron and Hermione.  It would have served the movie better to have shot Hermione not seated with or really associated with Ron and Harry until after the bathroom scene.  The movie in no way portrays this as a real turning point as it was in the books.  Likewise, Malfoy is underdeveloped as Potter's rival - in the movie he just smirks a lot. Finally, so many critical side characters were left out.  Fred and George hardly appear which is a horrible loss given the great comic relief they could have provided.  Peeves is absent altogether.\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: This movie is a true epic. The story is original, imaginative, and superbly done. One of the greatest movies ever made. It stands alone on its virtue, no gratuitous sex, violence or bad language. The graphics are also very well done, the setting very realistic. All the actors did a very convincing job, you believe they are who they portray. A must see for all.\n",

It needed to be much longer!  There were slight plot points left out of the film that were in the books, but I can only assume that they will be addressed in the following films since they are key points and issues that cannot be avoided without truly changing the storyline.  The films however for what they were, were smashing!!  I recommend everyone go see Harry Potter today!!\n",

Go see this film. It has all the wonderful elements of classic films.\n",

            "Rating: 8, Review: Harry Potter. The name has become synonymous with the merchandising that surrounds it. While the attempt to make as much money as possible is a major factor in the toy production, it seems that the movie itself had other motives: to accurately and successfully adapt the treasured first book in the series. Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is full of magic, mystery, and miscellaneous, as author J.K. Rowling derives style from books like Norman Juster's The Phantom Tollbooth and any of Roald Dahl's works. The movie keeps these delicate, creative qualities intact, while harnessing the advantages of film. The story follows 11 year old Harry Potter, from his wretched life with his aunt and uncle to his acceptance and enrollment at Hogwart's School of Wizardry. Harry must get acquainted to a new and magical world while he learns about his past and the mystery surrounding the heavily guarded Sorcerer's Stone. For those who read the book, the movie -- though 150 minutes long -- seems to rush. Though no plot is omitted, the extra detail that enhanced and decorated the book is missing. Fortunately, that is the biggest problem. When a three year old child and his parents can both sit still and enjoy a film for two and a half hours, something good is taking place. Director Chris Columbus (Home Alone) enhances his status in Hollywood with this film. He manages to make Harry Potter an interesting family film, full of suspense, intrigue, and humor, without resorting to childish jokes. All of the actors do a impressive job with their characters; even the child actors manage to evoke just the right emotion in the audience. Richard Harris and Maggie Smith make a fine team of professors. Harris plays Headmaster Dumbledore with the charm and intellect of the typical Merlin figure. Maggie Smith is perfect for the role of Professor McGonagall; she is strict and intimidating, but has good intentions and is always fair. The majority of the cast consists of experienced English actors who know how to use their character to power the conflicts and the plot development.\n",
            "Rating: 9, Review: I think Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone (or Philosopher's Stone, depending on where you live) will be a classic. It not only stays true to the book, but the casting is wonderful. Every actor in the movie is perfect for their character. Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter is brilliant. Emma Watson as Hermione Granger and Rupert Grint as Ron Weasley are excellent. The visual effects are \"state of the art technology\". Believe me, sitting in a dark theater for two and a half hours are absolutely worth every second.\n",
            "Rating: 1, Review: This movie is awful.Although it has some good actors.Emma Watson is horrible and i can't understand why is she in this movie.She is so terrible that you can't compare with other young actress like Dakota fanning and i think she isn't going to make more famous movies except harry potter saga. I can't see her in Hollywood movies with famous stars like NICOLE KIDMAN,TOM CRUISE or DUSTIN Hoffman.EMMA WATSON STINKS. She is horrible in all harry potter's movies.The most horrible acting is in HARRY'S POTTER AND THE STUPID Prisoner OF AZKABAN.She is the worst actress actress i have ever seen in my life.In this movie she is a teenager and she's horrible.she has a mud-face and frizzy-hair.She is going to be very bad in harry potter and the goblet of fire.Please Michael come here :regards to CHARLEY\n",

There are a few things that got cut, but all over it is an enjoyable, fanciful visual of the book. Some people may be disappointed, due to the fact that one of the rooms leading up to the last room where the sorcerer's stone is was cut. A definite must see for die-hard potter fans! I can't wait for the prisoner of azkaban. By the way I must note some parts seemed \"rushed\".\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: Very smart use of editing and special effects.  The story was told, and a little changed, but the change was not too drastic.  It was just right. Now, I'm going to watch it again, this time with the excuse of taking my little sister!\n",
            "Rating: 9, Review: For those of us who know the book backwards and forwards, at first glance the movie may seem a little disappointing.  It's hard to watch the movie without thinking with each scene \"oh, they've cut this out\", or \"they changed this a little bit\".  Much of the wit in the book - like Lee Jordan's hilarious commentary of the quidditch match, and the fight between Harry, Ron and Draco (and Scabbers!) on the train ride to Hogwarts - is missing in the film, which is unfortunate.  However, on second viewing, you know what to expect in the film (and what not to expect), and thus it is much easier to see the film for the enchantment that it is!  Dazzling sets and special effects make the film a visual stunner. Daniel Radcliffe excels at bringing Harry Potter to life, and even better, he has real chemistry with Rupert Grint's Ron - who, as the comedic relief, steals virtually every scene he's in - and Emma Watson's Hermione, who nails the character's know-it-all attitude perfectly.  Chris Columbus - who directed the incredibly awful \"Home Alone\" series - wisely avoids sappiness with \"Sorcerer's Stone\" and instead captures the dark tone that runs through Rowling's novel.  The movie-makers have done an excellent job at bringing the first novel in the Harry Potter series to life.  Can't wait to see what they do with the even better novel, \"Chamber of Secrets\"!\n",
            "Rating: , Review: The studios must have agonised over how to translate JK Rowling's 'instant classic' to the big screen.  Perhaps this was its problem.  From the first, each story is so tightly-plotted and intricately woven that it is nigh on impossible to have every important detail crammed into two and a half hours. Yet, this is exactly what Chris Columbus and his stellar cast attempted to do.\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: This is the story of Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe), an ordinary eleven-year-old boy serving as a kind of slave for his aunt and uncle, who finds out that he is in fact a wizard and has been invited to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Harry is pulled from his ordinary existence by Rubeus Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane), the gardener at Hogwarts, and quickly thrown into a world completely alien to both him and the viewer. Known for an incident at his birth, Harry easily makes friends at his new school.

            "Rating: 10, Review: If you haven't seen \"Harry\" yet, put aside the naysayers and nitpickers and take the Hogwarts journey for yourself.  You just might find it's your second favorite film, as it seem to be worldwide.  You'll find what you like or dislike for yourself, but watch for juicy turns by Alan Rickman, John Hurt and Maggie Smith (so THAT'S where Jean Brodie went!) and a lovable characterization by Robbie Coltrane...and see if you don't agree that at least three new careers are well underway with the top notch performances by the under-21s in this film, particularly, of course, Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint!  As with \"Oz\", I believe the years will see the first Harry Potter adventure grow into a classic and beloved film that kids today will enjoy with their children and their grandchildren.\n",

            "Rating: , Review: When Harry Potter came out, I thought it would be the best thing since sliced bread. However, when it ended, I was left feeling utterly disappointed. They cut the best bits, such as when they got rid of Baby Norbert. They also cut out Peeves, and the second Quidditch match. My friend loves Daniel Radcliffe, so she was happy with the film, although I doubt that she heard a word anybody said!!! The effects were nothing special, and it seemed like Ron, Hermione and Harry were friends from the start, which if you read the book, you will see that they are not.  But please understand, that this film is o.k. If you haven't seen it, then you should see it, but if you haven't read the books, see the film first, then read the book.\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: The first film is usually the perfect introduction to a film franchise and Harry Potter is the perfect example, the director (Chris Columbus), did an amazing job on the filming and he was amazing with the kids behind the scenes. To be honest because he did such a good job on the film he should've gotten an Oscar or some other movie award. It's amazing! The casting with Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint playing as the Golden Trio is also perfect! Also the fact that Chris Columbus wrote his own screenplay in order to make the film sound like the original book is also something that makes Chris the best director in the series.\n",

My expectations were nominally high, and I can safely say that they were all met.  With the exception of some very corny lines and actions towards the end, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone was a flawless gem.  I loved every second of it, even if You-Know-Who ended up reminding me of Darth Vader.  John Williams' score only accentuated the effect, of course.  ^_~  Definitely a high 9/near 10 in my book.\n",
            "Rating: , Review: I thought that this movie had a great cast.  Especially Alan Rickman as Snape.  He really put body to a minor character.  This leads me to my biggest qualm with the movie:  Minor characters were VERY minor. As in we hardly ever saw people like the twins or Nevile ect.  Secondly, the movie had scenes that did not mesh or flow and a lot of crucial scenes were left out.  As a result, the movie didn't even give off the same feeling as the book.  All in all, this movie was boring, and to see it would greatly compromize your interpratation of the book.  My advice:  Be patient and wait for the fifth book to come out!\n",

            "Rating: 5, Review: When the Harry Potter books first came out and began to capture the interests children and adults alike, I just brushed it off as another fad that would stay for a while and disappear without a trace. I wasn't interested in the books at all until one of my closest friends suggested that I read it. At first I declined and thought it would go against my style if I was sucked into the Potter craze. Then one day at the library, I noticed an entire shelf committed to Harry Potter books, written by the much loved author, J.K. Rowling. \"What harm could it do? I'll just read it, and then I can say 'I told you so' if i hate it.\" So, I borrowed all four books, took them home, and began to read. I was in for the biggest surprise of my life. I actually liked these books! I couldn't put them down, and I though I hate being proven wrong, a little part of me was glad that I had borrowed and read these books. Then I bought all four books from BN and anticipated the upcoming movie, \"Harry Potter and the Sorceror's Stone.\" After seeing the movie on the first day it came out (perhaps it was all the propaganda going around) I thought it was \"great.\" I saw it twice more and began to realize this movie wasn't that great. Some of the scenes in the novel are cut out, (some of them were my favorite), and was much disappointed in that. Other than that, I didn't imagine Professor M. to be that old. Sure, I knew she was old, but not THAT old. Hagrid wasn't that bad, except he appeared to be more stupid or absent minded in the movie than he had in the book. \"I shouldn't have said that.\" was repeated way too many times to receive laughter.\n",
            "Rating: 9, Review: Excellence and magic collide in this treat.I think that everything from the book was included in this movie.I think that this one was just such a good way to start off the movie series, not the books. \n",

            "Rating: 7, Review: I have to admit that I haven't read any of the amazingly popular novel's from which this movie came. However, after viewing this film, I am certainly tempted to do so. While this film is certainly designed for the preadolescent market, it has those necessary hooks to keep even the most hardened realist of an adult interested. \n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: I remember seeing this movie when I was 9 years old. I've read the book one year earlier and I continue reading it on, and on, and on... Just couldn't stop! And then I saw that movie about Harry was coming out and I just have to see it! I went with my entire class and our teacher! I was so excited and kept telling everybody what will happen and stuff, until someone told me to 'shut up, cause you're annoying!'. And I was! After I saw the movie (although I didn't understand what movie was at that time) I was pleased! Very pleased, indeed! I love that Chris Columbus was faithful to the book and J. K. Rowling's words. That world is so perfectly imagined and created that doing otherwise (and not respecting the story, like they planned to) would be just a huge disappointment to every child's dream! I know that Chris Columbus and the staff didn't spoil MY child dream! I'm most grateful for that and I just wish that Chris directed the other movies, not just 'Philosopher's Stone' and 'Chamber of Secrets'! The Chris's Harry Potter movies are the best!\n",
            "Rating: 6, Review: This movie is decent for those interested in this stuff.\n",
            "Rating: 7, Review: It's obvious that a lot of care went into the casting of this film, and it's a big part of why it is so successful. Richard Harris, as Headmaster Albus Dumbledore; Maggie Smith as Professor McGonagall; John Hurt as Mr. Ollivander; Ian Hart as Professor Quirrell. Exceptional performances from one and all, with two that stand out as especially memorable: Robbie Coltrane, who readily conveys the fact that Hagrid's heart is of a size that matches that of the man; and Alan Rickman, as Professor Severus Snape, deliciously droll while demonstrating menace through the fine art of articulation. \n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: Speaking as someone who has seen this movie over 200 times (no joke, people), I must say that there are a few flaws, as is the case with many a film. It is extremely rare this day and age to find a seamless film, and lets face it, with a main character that boasts only two pre-Sorcerer's Stone credentials, and neither of those happen to be one of my top 200 picks for a Friday night flick and a director who boasts such films as Bicentennial Man and Monkeybone, I think it's safe to say that most of the weight of this film rests on the shoulders of Chris Columbus and not David Radcliffe. And I must also admit that for an actor's second film and third acting job, he did above and beyond what I would expect of a nearly new actor, fresh on the market.\n",
            "Rating: , Review: Harry Potter is just another fad, like Pokemon and Livestrong bands, that refuses to go away. I attempted to read the first book of this painful saga and got bored out of my mind, then my friend dragged me to see this piece of crap. I had known that it ran 152 minutes and I would be bored out of my mind, but I didn't want to disappoint him. Aside from the brilliant \"Monsters, Inc.\" trailer made just for this movie, I nearly fell asleep! Who in their right mind pays $10 just to see some British kids to run around a castle for 3 hours? WB is killing off Looney Tunes for this?!?! How could the creator of the characters in \"Gremlins\" (a very good movie compared to this) and the director of \"Mrs. Doubtfire\" (another very good movie) pull this piece of crap? My 2 cents: save your money and rent the two I brought up above or support saving the Looney Tunes characters by watching some of their superior work compared to this.\n",
            "Rating: 7, Review: If you, like so many others, had high expectations for the movie because of how good the books were, then you would have walked away disappointed. A book as popular as Harry Potter could never have been done to appeal to all its fans because so many will pick out every little mistake in the film that doesn't coincide with the book.\n",

This movie takes me back to where it all began and how magic was treated in an adult proportional way.\n",
            "Rating: 8, Review: Looking back, a lot has changed since 2001. One of the things I think of when I notice how much has changed is the evolution of the series of Harry Potter. In 2001, the first Harry Potter film was released, and it became an instant classic for the next decade.\n",
            "Rating: , Review: Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is a timeless classic that has captivated audiences since its release in 2001. Directed by Chris Columbus and based on the novel by J. K.

            "Rating: 1, Review: This movie was not on my list of movies to see, but due to extenuating circumstances I found myself in the theater for this movie.  The best part by far was the Lord of the Rings trailer that was previewed before the movie.  I thought the movie was as decent of a rendition of the book as could be done in a two and a half hour movie, but lacked a lot of things which go back to the book.  The problem I have with the book and with the movie is the cult following that Harry Potter has, when it is nothing more than a kids story.  There are much better stories out there for kids and especially adults that make this story look cheap.  The book was entertaining, but lacks depth and a thought-provoking plot.  When I was young I was reading Lord of the Rings, The Count of Monte Cristo, the Three Musketeers and other classics.  These books help build vocabulary, develop the mind, and lead to reading other classics that provide a foundation for writing and creative thinking.  I have read the first Harry Potter book, and found the writing style repetitive, and the reading level less than desirable for anyone but a third grader.\n",

            "Rating: 10, Review: It's Harry Potter's first year at Hogwarts School, (the wizarding, magical school) and it also turned out to be his first adventure. Harry Potter made best friends with Ron Weasley and Hermoine Granger, who also turned out to help him in his adventures. He also gets to know about Voldemort, the evil wizard who killed his parents. He mistakens Severus Snape to bring his downfall, but actually, it was Professor Quirrell. Severus Snape tried to save him.\n",
            "Rating: 8, Review: The book has been 90% faithfully represented on screen to the film makers credit. However as with many of the other comments so far I honestly believe the feelings of wonder you have whilst reading the story are simply lost in the transition to film. The adults actors are fine, the children are on the whole cast well and the effects are OK but nothing special. I had read the book beforehand but the friend I saw this with had not, yet we both felt the same at the end - something was missing that's hard to pin point - something to stop us really liking the film as much as we would have hoped. I'd still recommend everyone to see it at least once to make up your own minds though - Potter fans or not.\n",
            "Rating: 8, Review: I would suggest to anyone that they should read J.K. Rowling's masterpieces before seeing this film, and the following films too. As is the case for nigh on all films based on novels, the film fights hard to match the book, and rarely succeeds (The Beach, Captain Corelli's Mandolin...) Although, in this case, one could say both the book and the film are the better of the two. Yes, J.K. Rowling wrote the books to be read, and they are incredible in that respect (Harry Potter isn't a world-wide phenomenon for nothing, after all), yet being all about magic and fantastic events, it would be difficult to match her words and our imaginations with on-screen action. Jurassic Park managed its realistic dinosaurs, and myriad other films have used computer graphics to allow the impossible to appear on film, except here they're not quite up to scratch. Blue-screen use is obvious, and even a five year old could tell you what's real and what's fake, and sadly it makes the world of Harry Potter less believable, and that's the root of the magic - the non-muggle world seems so real and is so well depicted in text that we all believe it exists, and can picture it all, yet on film it seems too fake in places. The Quidditch match was indeed very good, as was the half-giant Hagrid, with dear little Norbert....as for the (real) actors, Daniel Radcliffe performed as well as he could, although he is no Haley Joel Osment. Ron and Hermione were better, as was Oliver Wood. Best performances came from Maggie Smith as Prof. McGonagall, and the shifty-looking Snape, who oozed evil just with his darting eyes.\n",
            "Rating: 5, Review: A media hype, and a beaut'! I can't remember ever being so lied to by the media. They said it was the most succesful film ever. Not true! I too bought tickets way in advance. However, on the day of the premiere, the theater was more than half empty! Less than a dozen adults and some 40 children or so. Hardly what was expected after the 'raves' on TV. Some newspapers really said what happened in theaters nationwide and it was exactly like we experienced. Disappointment everywhere it seems...\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: Exceptional. Everything expected and more. Exactly as pictured in my imagination. They'd better hurry with the sequels, their perfect cast is growing up. Will definitely see this again. I just hope Lord of the Rings will be as fulfilling.\n",
            "Rating: 6, Review: this movie was just average. The special effects were good, but nothing special in a big budget movie today. The acting was fine, but generally typical of children's films. There were a few memorable scenes, but nothing really touching, moving, or exciting. The story was occasionally creative, but primarily built on cliches. In other words, average.\n",

            "Rating: 3, Review: I saw \"Harry Potter\" on Thanksgiving Day. My family and dinner guests were really looking forward to seeing this movie. I'd bought tickets as soon as they'd gone on sale to make sure that we'd be able to get seats on this very special American holiday.\n",
            "Rating: 7, Review: Of course, the book is better, but the movie stands on its own rather well. They did an excellent job of translating as much of the book as possible, editing smartly. Still, the pacing felt rushed to me, and there was never any real sense of the kids learning, no montage sequence of them in classes. Additionally, Quirrel was non-existent. there was no reason to fear him, nor Voldemort. The sense of danger must be developed in the following films. Still, I throughly enjoyed the movie.\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: This is one of the best adaptations of a book into a movie that I have ever seen. The movie's quality goes deeper than that, though. The settings brought Harry's world to life beautifully. The casting was nothing less than inspired. When I saw the characters walking around I felt as though I had been transported into the book, much as Harry was transported into Tom Riddle's diary in \"The Chamber of Secrets\" (I can't wait for that one to come out).\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: The movie starts off disappointingly slow, and Daniel Radcliffe, the boy playing the famous 'Boy Who Lived' at first delivers such an exaggerated performance that I was afraid he would turn out to be just another cardboard child actor, but then about fifteen minutes into the movie, everything picks up and I ended up having one of the best movie experiences of the year!\n",
            "Rating: 7, Review: Being a fan of the Harry Potter series, I was of course very interested in seeing the adaptation of \"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's stone\". Having now seen the film, I'm left with mixed feelings.\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: Having just seen HP and the Philosopher's Stone, I have to say it's one of the most enjoyable films i've seen in a long while.  Perhaps slightly long for a young audience, but for older watchers fantastic entertainment. \n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: This is movie is great. First i did not want to go, thinking it's movie for children, but i am not sorry i went. The plot is well done, the special effects are more than great. It's a movie about courage, friendship, discovering your inner strength, so it's a movie for everybody! My advice: go see it! You won't regret it!\n",
            "Rating: , Review: I was somewhat disappointed in the movie. I don't think they did a great job making it as magical as it should be. I think they could have put a little more effort in making the Quidditch match, and spells seem a little more real, and not look so computer-animated.\n",
            "Rating: 9, Review: Having read the books several times, as I always do before seeing any movie made after a well-known book, I thoroughly enjoyed this representation. The second time I saw it I tried to think of just the movie, without comparing it to the book. Clearly, this a difficult task, because it's not easy to just forget what you know. I think I enjoyed the movie even more the second time, though I can't say for sure that it was for that reason.\n",
            "Rating: 7, Review: ...however I was left thinking that the movie just didn't compare with the richness of the book.  While there were moments of great fun, I really felt it missed the feeling of the books to some extent.  I am glad I saw it, and enjoyed it but couldn't help but think that those who hadn't read the books would be totally confused.\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: Many film critics seem to be hitting some of the same points in their reviews:  The film is too faithful to the book; the film is too long; the director didn't take enough risks; there's 'something missing' here. Generally, I do agree that the film had one too many set pieces, but I disagree that the film was too faithful to its source.  I think nearly all the scenes in \"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\" were necessary to tell the whole story, something most Hollywood movies have a hard time doing these days.  Isn't it refreshing to see a film where each scene actually flows logically into the next?\n",
            "Rating: 9, Review: Well I've not really read any of the books besides the first one and I must say that the transition from text to full visual splendor is truly amazing and looks very very accurate. Add a top rate cast and a top rated director to the cauldron and you get a very very entertaining and wonderful series. The first movie was excellent. The second one was darker, scarier and even better than the first. The third one was the worst of the lot, mostly attributable to bad direction, overdownsizing of the story and some degradation in acting. The fourth one is not as good as the first two but improves a bit over the third one. All four movies are worth watching at least once though. They are all really good.\n",
            "Rating: 9, Review: I remember first seeing this in an awesome movie theatre... the first day the movie came out, November, 2001. My sister and I were jumping up and down, dying to see it... we were both about 11...\n",
            "Rating: 8, Review: I sat in a multiplex theater....down near the front as all the higher seats were taken already. We went on Day 1 and had purchased our tickets online 2 weeks ahead.  When we got there we found 4 theaters had the film and all 4 were sold out for the next 2 showings!\n",
            "Rating: 7, Review: OK, it's got some funny moments and some inspired little bits not in the book (I loved the tip of the hat to Gladiator just before the Quidditch match), but it is not the whimsical, innovative movie it could have been. Excellently cast but most of the actors seemed to be somewhat subdued (Daniel Radcliffe as Potter is particularly wooden).\n",

            "Rating: 10, Review: This is a perfect movie.  As a matter of fact, it was almost too perfect. The story (with minor exceptions) is true to the book.  It is visually beautiful with good acting.  It was like reliving the reading of the book, because it was so much like I imagined it.  I can't believe it has the same rating as, say, the t.v. movie \"Night Sins\", which was a likeable piece of trash, but still trash.\n",
            "Rating: 6, Review: I have to admit, I hated this movie upon first viewing, but then again what could live up to the anticipation I had to see it, my mind had already pictured how the characters looked and acted.  To make things worse, I waited for the DVD so the anticipation was really major.  Now that I watch it again, knowing what I know, I like it.  I try to forget about the book and let the movie play.  I do feel however that sometimes the background music felt wrong and loud.  Sometimes it just didn't fit, and I usually love John Williams Soundtracks.\n",
            "Rating: , Review: However, that is where all praise stops. Having read all of the books (due to gentle nudging by my girlfriend), as well as having enjoyed all the books immensely, I was hoping for a lot in this movie. What I got... well, 95% of the story elements were in place, but 0% of the heart and magic were missing. Which kind of sucks, seeing how they are at a school for magic.\n",
            "Rating: 6, Review: I don't consider myself a huge Harry Potter fan - still, I've read all the books and enjoyed them a great lot. I was quite anxious to see how well was the atmosphere of the books translated to the big screen. I'm sorry to join the displeased side, but the movie IS disappointing - to say the least.\n",

Harry is treated amazingly poorly by his aunt and uncle, who, despite his being an \"immense burden\", adopted Harry after his mother and father's death. Upon Harry's twelfth birthday his life begins to change; wild unexpected occurrences begin to frazzle Harry's aunt and uncle, but the result of the change is a whole new life of which Harry could not have dreamed.\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: I remember when it was first released that there would be a movie and the millions of fans started asking questions like: who will play Harry and who will play Hagrid. Then people started thinking that there was no way the movie could be as good as the book and were sure Chris Columbus would screw it up. When the film finally came out people went expecting to see a bad movie made simply to make money from all the fans. But it was so much more than that the movie would be popular even without the popularity of the book it is good in it's own right and Daniel Radcliff was perfect for the part of Harry.\n",
            "Rating: 6, Review: unlike my wife who had read all the books, I just couldn't be bothered, being easily offput in my old(ish) age (well, 32) with overly praised kids films, even if I am a big kid at heart.\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: Probably the best book-to-movie adaption I have seen! That aside, the movie stands as an incredible adventure that had me crying, laughing, cheering, and clapping with everyone else. I would recomend this movie to wizards and muggles alike!\n",
            "Rating: 8, Review: I find this Film brilliant although it will never compare (for me anyways) to the book. Redaing is my thing and when I read the books I feel J.K is bringing you into the books because of the way she describes everything.\n",

            "Rating: 3, Review: The first half hour or so my focus on Harry Potter was still there excusing all the obvious clues that this will be a flop to slow start.  But after more of the same thing the bells began to ring that I might have to put up with this for the remainder of the movie.\n",
            "Rating: , Review: I REALLY tried to enjoy this movie but it just didn't happen. Perhaps I got too caught up in the unneccessary hype but in that case I think that reviewers and critics alike got caught up too much in the same stuff, so much caught up were they that they didn't really see this film for how bland it really was. Had this been a kids fantasy film released without the unneccessary baggage it would have recieved a whole string of 5s out of 10 as opposed to the sometimes insanely brilliant reviews critics accorded it.\n",

I went to the movie simply because my family wanted to go.  What can I say, the movie was magnificent.  The acting was flawless, from Harry to Snape to Dumbledore to Hagrid.  The sets had a perfect feel to them.  The experience of Harry seeing the magical world was seeing him finding everything new, wonderful, amazing yet somehow right, the way things should be, the place he belonged.\n",

            "Rating: 9, Review: This is a great adaptation of a great book. The only thing missing were the extra bits and pieces that build certain characters for the next couple of books, but seeing as how it was so long anyway it would be difficult to justify keeping things like that in.\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: I enjoyed watching Harry Potter! I was impressed by how well the movie follows the book, although there were a few things that got left out that I felt could have been included, like Snape's Potions Puzzle that Harry solves just before advancing on to face Quirrel. I felt that that could have been included. Other than that, Harry Potter is a great movie for kids of all ages!!\n",

            "Rating: , Review: I would have to completely disagree with tfrizzle who has put his/her view on saying that basically this film was crap. I think that Chris Columbus has created a masterpiece of the books and it is a film that will appeal to many people. Yes I was not keen on seeing the film when it first came out but since then I have see it and loved it. The philosophers stone started me on the whole Harry Potter books and I have read all of them over again as well as watching all the Harry Potter films many times. You might say I am a fan. Which I am happy to say I am. Daniel Radcliffe does remarkable in this film as do Emma Watson and Rupert Grint. It cannot be easy playing a character from a book that many children and adults have read about and have their own picture of that character but all the actors do this brilliantly. After reading the book and then watching the film again I am happy to say that there is no problem with the film. Christopher Columbus has put this book to screen with no faults. A marvelous idea to do so i think and I look forward to the forth film coming out which I know will be even better than the first three. Well done to all members of this film. A wonderful idea to bring Harry Potter to cinema.\n",
            "Rating: 3, Review: Perhaps one of the most boring films I have ever paid to watch at the cinema. Nothing really happens in this film, and when it did I couldn't have cared less. The kid that plays Harry seems to spend the entire film gazing in awe at magical things. \"Ooohh! A magic mirror! Ooooh! Magic moving staircase\".....Magical goings on? Well a you are at a school of magic so get over it Harry....and he is told over and over again that \"You are a wizard Harry!\" which seems to surprise him every single time.....\n",

Daniel Radcliffe as the title role of Harry Potter is clearly nervous but pulls the part off very well.

Emma Watson as geek Hermione Granger steals the film, her fantastic acting and attitude is outstanding and you really can sympathise with her.\n",
            "Rating: 9, Review: Now a cultural phenomenon with a mature cast and a excellent representation of talent British filmmaking can offer, 'Harry Potter & The Philosopher's Stone' remains the latter, played by a fresh-faced trio we forget we first joined back in 2001. As such, their over emphasis and misplaced charisma can be forgiven, as it gives the original film a childish charm that is actually much appreciated, given that the later films in the series evolved with author J.K Rowling's darkening narative.\n",
            "Rating: 8, Review: The first thing that has annoyed me is that I came to write a comment about Harry Potter and the PHILOSOPHER'S!!! Stone. Why the American's have changed the title I do not know. The PHILOSOPHER'S Stone is a much better title but maybe the American publicists felt that they had to dumb it down but I do not understand why as it does not need a lot of extra brain power to pronounce the extra syllable!! This is one of my favourite children's films, mainly because I fell in love with the book. It was the first children's book that I really got into and was left wanting more after the last page. Although this film does follow the book in terms of plot it did leave many of the enchanting subplot's out. Such as when Harry is recounting his muggle life and the way that he flew up to a chimney to avoid the bullies. This would have looked great on film and many kids could relate to it.\n",
            "Rating: , Review: The Goofs section of this IMDb makes several statements that are just ridiculous. Complaints about the plot are just silly. The plot comes strait from the novel, whose plot makes perfect sense...given a world of magic. The fact that some things don't make perfect sense, like detention in the off-limits forest, is part of the charm of the Potter stories. Whoever wrote these complaints either hasn't read the books, or just doesn't get Rowling's humor.\n",

I take my first chance to leave the room when the autistic child I am primarily there for calls me. I never even get to the opening scene. well unfortunately I am forced back out of his room when he falls asleep leaving me now no excuse to not go into the living room to torture myself to sleep watching this awful movie. I think to myself, the bathroom? No dice, the children offer to pause the movie for me. UHhh, alright, I will watch what is left. Maybe 40 minutes, I tell myself as I sit down. \"What is happening?\", \"Shhhhhh!\" they tell me. \"who is that?\" I ask. I get a finger telling me to wait a minute. \"wait, rewind it a second, did that just happen?\" \"ARRRRRRRR\" the kids yell \"watch it on your own time let us finish it!\" they yell. and sure enough I did. Since then I have read the books ( took me like 4 days to read the two books that where out then) and have been hooked on the books since. I loved the second movie but compared to the books, the 3rd and 4th movies where flops. this movie was the bait and will always be loved. It follows the book pretty closely and the director did a great job with everything.\n",
            "Rating: , Review: Although I haven't read the books, I went to see the movie, since everybody in Oxford was talking about it being filmed here and I was very curious to see our university on the screen. And it really looked amazing - the wonderful dining hall of Christ Church looked even more magnificent, and the old library - more mysterious. But although I really loved the scenery, I liked the story and acting even more! The actors are wonderful, especially the children, and it's truly admirable how well they acted. There are some great jokes and in general, the story is really enjoyable, even for people over 21. Now I only have to read the books. :)\n",

            "Rating: 9, Review: When I saw this movie I had not read a single word of any Harry Potter books, or seen any trailers for this particular movie. Then a good friend of mine dragged me to see this movie. I was very, very, very surprised. To put it simple, I have now read all four of the Harry Potter books, within a month's time, and seen the movie FIVE times in theaters within two months of the release.\n",
            "Rating: , Review: I saw this film with my 6 year old daughter and we both enjoyed it very much.  We didn't really realize the length of the film until we left the theater.  My daughter didn't get antsy at all!  I thought it was paced well and not too violent or frightening.  All the acting was okay, the veterans of course were excellent along with the child actor playing Ron Weasley. My main complaint was with the continuity of the film.  I suppose it is very difficult to film a movie with child actors as they must grow like weeds throughout the production.  This particular movie was obviously filmed in non-sequential order as Harry ages throughout but not so in a continuous manner.  He's young, He's old, oops he's young again!\n",
            "Rating: 5, Review: Very disappointing.  Too much time spent indulging in fair-to-middling special effects to the detriment of the essence of the books - the ugly duckling who finally discovers his own kind, the value of friendship, the difficulty of doing good.  This movie is Harry Potter lite.  The effects were not that special, Harry is too wooden and boring, Ron sneers like a music hall villain, and some of the most effective parts of the story were left out.\n",
            "Rating: 8, Review: Unlike many books, which when produced on film lack the substance of print, this movie directed by Chris Columbus has stayed oh so true to J. K. Rowling's book.  I am sure that if it had strayed far from the text there may have been a revolt of children around the world!\n",
            "Rating: 5, Review: Why couldn't we wait thirty years for some young kid who grew up reading these books to put his vision on to the screen. Why must we immediately cash in on a franchise that's barely even gotten off the ground? Why does Chris Columbus feel like he is capable of directing anything? Why does anyone think that by simply creating CG visual effects and REALLY LOUD sound effects the audience will be amazed. Why isn't the whole movie nearly as suspensful as the live chess game. Why is the plot of the film only revealed in the last forty minutes. Why is this movie so long when scenes that obviously serve the sole purpose of pandering to the readers of Harry Potter need to be cut? Why was Alan Rickman even in the movie, other than to look very shifty? Why does this movie seem to be missing any affection towards it subject, or rather, why does this film seem like it is fueled purely by the tradition of making lots of money, fast? Why did i pay $8.50?\n",
            "Rating: 6, Review: I saw this in a theater that was completely full, with a crowd that buzzed excitedly over the Scooby Doo preview before the feature.  The major thing that I noticed was the complete lack of buzz during the film.  No laughs, no sudden breaths, very little sound at all.  I think the movie simply moved too fast, and everyone felt the need to focus on the screen completely so as not to miss anything.  I understand the problems in adapting a widely read and hugely successful novel to a screenplay, so I empathize with the screenwriter. I enjoyed the film, even at the 2.5 hour length, and I recommend that fans of the books see it, but I do not think children under 7-8 would sit through the second half. One negative (somewhat) was the seeming lack of special effects in a movie about a wizard.  What effects were there were fairly shoddy. The three main actors, particularly the adorable little Hermione, were wonderful.  But why was John Cleese included for a two line role?  The same for John Hurt. Overall, 6 out of 10\n",
            "Rating: , Review: The film is decent but has some failings. The primary one being that it follows the book too precisely. Alterations need to be made in order to convert a book to a screen adaptation; and due to fears of disappointing fans, these necessary changes were not made. The movie plods along at a turtle's pace. There is no speed up to move faster through slow sections, and a neglect of slowing down through the important sections. For example, an opening scene in which Harry Potter receives his letter to Hogwarts could have been shortened, without taking away from the film. Meanwhile his entire time spent at the school was run through, such that I never got a feeling for Harry's experience. Many comparisons have been made between Harry Potter and LOTR because the movies came out at the same time, and both are adaptations from well respected books. However, LOTR is an excellent example of how to edit the content in the process of conversion. Harry Potter demonstrates how to show a little bit of everything, without removing unnecessary bits and amplifying important moments. Therefore the film plodded through the story, as if performing a chore... Overall I would only recommend this movie if you live preoccupied with the notion that every decent film adaptation is actually blasphemy to the book.\n",
            "Rating: 3, Review: Somebody was more interested in getting rich than turning an entertaining book into a quality film.   The movie felt thrown together in a hurry for a holiday release.  I was also disappointed by the absence of many important details.  It saddens me to think what they will do with the fourth book - what will they have to leave out considering book #4 is 4x's longer than book #1.\n",
            "Rating: 3, Review: I very much disliked this movie. Yes, it could have been worse (the opinion that made my sister elbow me in the stomach), but I don't know how much. As a movie it wasn't that bad at all, but as a movie based on a book? No. While they did stick to the story better than they could have, it still wasn't very good. They left out parts, added parts, moved parts around...\n",
            "Rating: , Review: I went with my kids, one of whom has read all the books at least once.  I have read some.  Get this straight.  The film is not exciting.  It plods. Nor is it funny.  The locations are great but that is about it. So what if it is faithful to the book?  Then why see it? The acting is mediocre at best (Potter not even that), as are the special effects.  The kids thought it ok, a similar reaction to Phantom Menace.  Films for kids (or maybe all) should be funny or exciting or both.  We found it neither. I am sure they got much more out of Jurassic Park III, I certainly did.  I'd give it 5.  Lets hope Rings is better.\n",

            "Rating: 10, Review: The most common words spoken by fans of the Harry Potter books have been \"That was just as I imagined it!\" And being one of those fans, seeing Harry Potter was on odd experience, I felt as if I'd seen it before. It was very close to the book, and was nearly complete. I cannot wait for the dvd, and the Chamber of Secrets! See the Sorcerer's Stone- you will not regret it. It truly is a magical experience.\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: I agree with what scmovieguy wrote, and just want to add a few more things. (Have read all the books several times and saw the first two showings on opening day) First, I was very impressed with the performance of Tom Felton as Draco Malfoy. My impression from reading the book was that the character was a typical (cliched) spoiled rich kid; however, from this performance I began to see the way that Draco is boxed in and trapped by his influential father and wealthy family.\n",
            "Rating: , Review: Yeah yeah yeah i think rather too many people have got caught up in the hype. This film was slow, boring and lacking in any charm or character. The lead actor has no facial expressions at all, even the quiditch game seems laboured. Go and watch it but don't expect much, then you won't be disappointed.\n",
            "Rating: 2, Review: This is what happens when you let an American director completely spoil a superb British book (yes nothing to do with America at all). There is so much missed out of this film that was in the book, and some of the parts that are in the book have been changed and they are so lame it's unbelievable. As for the characters, I don't think i've ever seen an actor (if you can call him that) as wooden as Daniel Radcliffe. Another mistake by the Americans, picking an actor as expressionless as Radcliffe to play our main character. Ron is OK, but he is how you would imagine him to be. Hermione may be fit but she's way too soppy for the film and doesn't do the Hermione from the book justice. As for Alan Rickman as Snape, you couldn't pick a worse person for the part. Don't get me wrong, Rickman is a fantastic actor, but I couldn't stand to watch him in this. His performance can only be summed up in one word: pathetic. Now that Columbus and Cuaron have f*cked off and handed over the directing reigns to an Englishman, I look forward to the new film, the Goblet of Fire. I hope that this new director, brings Harry Potter to life and save the books, now that Chris Columbus and Alfonso Cuaron have given them such a sh*t reputation with their weak, atrocious portrayals of what is, in my opinion, one of the best books I've ever read. Miss it if you can, and oh yeah, i am not prejudiced against Americans but it's called Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, none of this Sorcerer's Stone crap thank you very much!\n",
            "Rating: 6, Review: I was so disappointed with this movie. The first part of the movie before Harry gets to Hogwarts was just terrible! If I hadn't read the book, it would not have made any sense. Crucial scenes were cut out so that there was no transition, and the acting was weak. The changes between really dark scenes and really bright scenes were not well done either. The Dursleys were not as I had imagined them to be, especially Mr. Dursley. The casting of the Weasleys (except for Ron) was just downright wrong. The twins fun, happy-go-luckyness, and humour were not captured - the lines that were supposed to be funny were delivered without conviction, and the twins became dull barely existent characters. \n",
            "Rating: 3, Review: If ever there was a movie case of the Emperor's New Clothes, it's this. Can two and a half hours possibly have gone more slowly? Could they possibly have found a group of supporting child actors quite so bad? Could the great Steve Kloves really have written this or did they just allow the actors to make it up as they went along? pants, pants, pants. Yawn. And it'll probably be the most successful film of all time. How depressing.\n",

            "Rating: , Review: ...but disappointing nonetheless. I admit to having read the sorcerer's stone a long time ago, before it was \"cool\" for adults to read these books. Personally, if adults go for these books, then I can tuthfully say our society has been \"dumbed down\" to the point that most people should go back to first grade. I have never seen Harry Potter as the breath of fresh air that so many people claim it is. The movie follows the shortcomings of the book, being a good kids' story, but far too bland and childish for any mature adult to like. If you claim to love harry potter just so your kids will think you are cool, then you're not even as mature as they are. There have been dozens of children's fantasy franchises that would make better movies than this. Chris Columbus, how could you SELL OUT like that? If you want your kids to read something imaginative, then introduce them to Lord of the Rings, so at least maybe they can get a sense of good or evil from the story.\n",

            "Rating: 10, Review: No movie can be like a book, but if I had to choose which of the book based movies I ve seen follows the book best and closest that would be Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. The changes were so few that the unfair negative commends I hear here and there for this movie made me to right a review about it.\n",
            "Rating: 7, Review: For starters, i am a huge Harry Potter fan. Not because it's a craze right now or because everyone else is reading it, but because I read the books and have grown a love for them, for the amazing story lines and intricate plot points. And the characters are all three dimensional and well written, and you can't help but feel for them. JK Rowling has put a lot of time and planning into this little baby of hers, and it shows.\n",
            "Rating: 9, Review: Can't believe how much the experience of seeing the movie matched my expectations.  Columbus was so faithful to the book that we can now set aside that worry and look at the film.  His choices of actors for the movie were perfect; while never a Richard Harris fan, he IS Dumbledore.\n",
            "Rating: 9, Review: I hadn't read the books prior to seeing the movie, so my vision of it may be somewhat skewed, but I was inordinately impressed with the movie.  Richard Harris plays Dumbledore to perfection (he might have made almost as good a Gandalf as Ian McKellan, though the comparison won't be popular), Maggie Smith's McGonnagall is equally good and the boy who plays Harry himself is excellent, though his youth sometimes shows itself a little.  And Robbie Coltrane as Hagrid steals the show! All in all a good first installment. My hope is that, like the Star Wars and Star Trek movies of yesteryear, the second installment is even better than the first!\n",

            "Rating: 5, Review: A classic example of why you don't just 'act out the book' when interpreting a novel for the screen. The film, while it looked and felt right in terms of visualisation and tone, was a lifeless quick once-over of the plot, leaving those who hadn't read the book (friends I went with) thinking it was rather a lame story. A real shame and a poor advertisement for the book. None of the British wit and charm of the story was preserved, substitued instead for weak Hollywood laughs (3 kids screaming in unison, then turning 2 seconds later and running out of the room -gimme a break).\n",

            "Rating: 10, Review: I was very impressed how well Chris Columbus was able to stick with the JK Rowling book. Usually most movies veer off along the way. But this was really well done; the acting was great, the scenes were quite like I had pictured them while reading the books. The books are a great read, and the movie is really the icing on the cake.\n",
            "Rating: 1, Review: What can I say, I've not read the books and i'm not gonna now. After JK Rowling's pathetic feature I grudge giving the Rowling Potter machine any more cash. Why? The film lacks everything, wooden acting with a script that should end Steven Kloves' career(but won't due to the hype behind this waste of celluloid)(really Steve, Wonder Boys was good, baker boys was fantastic, but Potter should be your epitaph). Maggie Smith's Script was cringingly poor, Robbie Coltrane started the film as a 'Ooo bee there farmer' from Cornwall, and ended up as his usualy Glaswegian self, part from that he was by far the best Adult in the film. Rickman was well.... typical Rickman, no thought to his character in the script as he could have been better used. All other actors like Cleese, Hunt and Walters had the right idea, and lasted about 2 minutes each(take the money and run folks) The CGI in the film was appauling, note all the scenes with the castle in the background and anything in front of it. This was not helped by the trailer of Lord of the Rings being screened before the film started.(Chris Dickson has no idea on Special effects, and no doubt the review was written by Rowling herself) The ending was dull and could have been more interesting than it's failed attempt. As for the twist at the end and how Harry Beat Voldemort, 'Oh yeah I got it....' it was clear to the whole audiance that it was a complete copout(underlying message was okay if the kids would ever have the brains to work it out, too deep and meaningful for the film). The film should have been a 3 part kids drama, the cgi would have looked a bit better on the small screen(but still not good, it would have looked like a medium budget TV dramas attempt at special effects). But hey they need all those toys sold this christmas... Why was the film made again?\n",
            "Rating: 2, Review: I think this movie disappoints due to its poorly done special effects/animation.  EEEk!  My kids were horribly disappointed because things \"were not as they imagined it\" and \"looked fake\" and (according to them) \"were outright wrong\"!  Even basic blue-screening effects were simply terrible, and FX were often used just to use them, as opposed to enhancing the story.\n",
            "Rating: 6, Review: Second rate special effects and not enough humor to help you get through a 2 1/2 hour movie.  I am assuming you have to have some knowledge of the books to understand, I did not so much of it was boring.  What would have helped would have been some American actors to provide comic relief (Robin Williams).\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: The movie is so true to the book that it was almost like reading (and enjoying) it again. Wonderful effects and superb acting allow me the pleasure of saying that I really enjoyed this \"kids\" movie! It was well worth the wait.\n",

            "Rating: 9, Review: I have eagerly awaiting the arrival of the Harry Potter movie ever since I took the time to read the books this past summer. I went to see the film Saturday afternoon with probably one hundred other people like myself and I can honestly say I left the theater feeling satisfied. Everything worth noting from the book was included in the movie, the casting and special effects were superb, and I felt as though I was being exposed to Harry Potter's world for the first time all over again. I was really skeptical on how Chris Columbus would do, but now I can't imagine any other film by any other director. I gave the movie a 10 because my feelings about this movie are on the same level as Wizard of Oz or E.T.; I can see myself watching this movie 10 years from now and enjoying every minute.\n",

            "Rating: 10, Review: Harry Potter and the Sorceror's Stone was everything I could have imagined after listening to my 11 year old son talk about this for two years now! Not having read the book the film is based on, I was completely swept away by the grandeur of the entire film.  The cast is both familiar and new, and the blend works perfectly.  The direction of Chris Colombus moves the story along, and the scenery and special effects are dazzling.  If you have a young child that lives within your soul, let him/her out for a few hours to enjoy a magical journey!\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: Harry Potter is a much more elegant and  seamless film. LOTR was missing too many parts and such. Really, HP was interesting and visually aesthetic. I am thankful Spielberg didn't get his hands on this film and put that Haley Joel Osment kid in there. I shudder to think what that would be like. Anyway, anyone who feels this film offend wiccas should shake their heads. I mean, it is only a kids movie, that's like saying Star Wars is offensive to NASA.\n",

            "Rating: 7, Review: This is a movie where the central characters are kids. I've never seen a movie where the central characters were kids and the movie wasn't childish. Harry Potter is no exception, but I can say it's certainly one of the better ones. There were still quite a few parts in the movie where I winced at how stupid it was and gritted my teeth waiting for the pain to stop but after it was all over looking back at it I can say it's certainly a great movie to take your kids to, but if you're looking for anything serious or you cherish a thought provoking script you better look elsewhere. Don't be fooled by the hype, it really is a kids movie. If you're a big kid go for it :)\n",

But still the film is amazing and keeps you on your seat. This is the film everyone is talking about.\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: Well well, the first Harry Potter movie.  Too bad the person that played Harry couldn't act his way out of a wet paper bag.  Other than that, the movie, tho not all true to the book, was great.  I especially enjoyed Prof. Snape, for I think he was best acted.  I was deeply saddened that they did not have Peeves in the movie, which was a bad move because he plays some pretty large rolls in the next few books.\n",

            "Rating: , Review: OK, first off I have to admit that I thoroughly enjoyed the book, so perhaps I am biased!  However, I went with people who knew nothing of Harry Potter et al but they enjoyed it as much (if not more than) myself.\n",
            "Rating: , Review: I should have known!!  I've seen Chris Columbus' work in the past:  he's been a consistently uninspired director in his previous films.  What possessed me to think that he would sublimate to something better this time. It had to have been peer pressure!  All those wonderful reviews, and glowing, practically gushing user comments.....I found myself forking over just shy of $10 and was eager for the consciousness-expanding event everyone was promising.  About an hour into Harry Potter, the only thing expanding was boredom and a certain irritation.  I must say, at this point, that I love fantasy....ever since I was a kid.  I've read and cherished Tolkien and Piers Anthony.  I haven't read Rowling, but I'm sure I would have enjoyed it just as much.  Therefore, I was quite excited during the previews in spite of the nagging problem with Columbus being the director.  What I received was more than 2 hours of blockbuster mediocrity all dressed up with noise and serviceable special effects.  The quality of style seemed to deteriorate as the movie progressed.  The final battle for the Stone at the end was stylistically awful.  The goofy head of the villain fused to the back of the instructor was on par with some of the creatures seen in mid-80's horror flicks.  I remember laughing out loud.  And did anyone notice the wretched editing??!!  This amazed me.....I mean how many bazillion dollars went into the film, and you have Dennis the Menace doing the editing.  If you haven't read the book or seen the movie, avoid the latter.  Read the book and let your imagination put the author's intent into its rightful place.\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: Harry Potter met many standards that were hard to step up to, considering the imaginative depictions that J. K. Rowling created. The film was able to meet many of those standards, becoming one of the only films to successfully portray an outstanding book. Not only was the story almost true to its form but it also was visually stunning. Plus, the cast could not have been better. To be honest, I was fearful of butchery caused by the bad acting skills that children generally provide. Thank goodness for the excellent casting director who placed Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, Emma Watson, and Tom Felton in this movie. Though they are all young they have talent beyond that of their peers. If not for the visually stunning beauty and acting alone, Harry Potter is a must-see film.\n",
            "Rating: , Review: I don't see what the big deal about Harry Potter is. The movie was boring as hell and I fell asleep twice. I tried to read the book and only made it to chapter 3, I kept wondering if the book would get anywhere. So I went to see the gods forsaken movie and found out the book really doesn't get to any point. And know I'm the only person that probably hated this movie, which is really a shame too.\n",
            "Rating: 8, Review: I really liked Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, but I felt it lacked some of the essentials from the book. Like when Harry gets fitted with his robes, he meets a blonde haired boy (Draco Malfoy). This is important because the relationship between the two is vital to the Harry Potter series - it's when they first meet and its significant. Harry doesn't know what Draco's like at that time, it's only later that he really sees Draco for what he is. From that point on, Draco and his friends make it very hard for Harry and his friends. I was disappointed that they didn't show the duel between Draco and Harry. I also thought that at some points the movie went a little fast. It also seemed that some connections in the book were not properly done in the movie. For example, they should have shown the Dursleys before Harry was brought to live with them - it obvious that they don't want anything to do with magic and the first part of Chapter 1 shows this. Overall, the movie was well done but hopefully Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets will go a touch more indepth and better show important connections.\n",

It's really hard to follow the story if you missed one episode.. and there are times that I need to rewatch the previous film before proceeding to the next one so that I can follow or remember the story..\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: A wonderful story to sweep you away from reality. It's a movie that will stand the test of time. Loads of wonderful characters all with great back stories. Set in a magical world that makes any adult want to become a child again and go on an adventure. They did very well converting the book to movie. A few things got lost in translation, but nothing to terrible. All in all, the best of its kind!\n",
            "Rating: 7, Review: The first film in the series does a successful job in creating a nostalgic and warm viewing experience. While the adult actors do a sterling job throughout the film, the age and lack of experience of the first year students lends to some cringeworthy moments.\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: It is unlikely that there will be a person who will leave a negative type of review for this film. Well, I don't believe it! Where did this story begin? From the boy who stood on the platform. With shaggy black hair, a slim build and round glasses. The real incarnation of Harry Potter inspired JK Rowling for her great books. Yes, they are already valued more than the Torah (Old Testament)!\n",
            "Rating: , Review: I thought that this movie would be good from the scenes. But it was the stupidist movie i have ever seen. I have to agree with the critics that the movie was way too faithful to the book that it didn't have have any sort of dramatic element (of movies.) The Harry Potter movie is a proof that why a movie shouldn't be too faithful to the original book.\n",

            "Rating: , Review: i am a fan of the book and i am really disappointed with the film... the only thing that i like about it is the diagon alley and quidditch match! it's quite draggy and the acting is not very well done. u can see some of the actors looking at the camera! well..i dunno... \n",
            "Rating: 5, Review: Perhaps my expectations were way too high, but this movie left me with little incentive to see the next installment although I'm still planning on reading all the books (yes, I'm the guy who hasn't read any Harry yet). Although the special effects were wonderful and the acting quite good overall and the story interesting I never connected with any of the characters and the movie seemed more an episodic exercise than a connected whole.  Maybe it's the directing and maybe it was TOO faithful to the book, although my spouse says otherwise, but for me it lacked the overall sense of wonder that I felt I should have.\n",
            "Rating: 9, Review: Rowling is well aware of what readers want: to explore worlds of utter novelty; Experience good emotional experience; The process is full of unknown suspense. All three elements are at their peak.\n",

            "Rating: 10, Review: When we look back to the past 20 years, we can see a booming selling of fantasy fictions aiming at children, adolescents and young adults in English literature. This wave of booming YA (young adult) fictions can be even remembered in history since some of these books and movie adaptations has broken the record of book selling and box office for several times. Examples abound. Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, the first of the seven Harry Potter series, has sold for more than 120 million copies since 1997, making it one of the best-selling fictions in human history just behind Don Quijote(500 million copies), A Tale of Two Cities (200 million copies), The Little Prince (200 million copies), The Lord of Rings (150 million copies). The other six books of the Harry Potter series also have a selling record of around 70 to 60 million copies, make them comparable with The Catcher in the Rye, The bridges of Madison County, Ben-Hur, Lolita, Heidi, Charlotte's Web, Anne of Green Gables, The Adventure of Pinocchio. When we take all these seven books into account, Harry Potter can be considered the best-selling book series in human history with more than 500 million copies that can only be challenged by Xinhua Dictionary (567 million copies), the Quran, the Bible and Quotations from Chairman Mao. Considering the unstoppable decline of paper books in the foresee future, such selling records may not be able to be surpassed in the human history. All of its eight movie adaptations were among the top-two best-selling movies of the year, and the Wizarding World movies series earned a total box office of 9.6 billion dollars, making it the third best-selling movie series just behind the Marvel Universe and the Star War series. What is more, such phenomenon can also be witnessed among other YA fictions and their movie adaptations, including the Twilight Sagas, the Hunger Games, and to a less extend the Percy Jackson series, the Shadow Hunter series, the Divergent series, and the Running Maze series. So, the question is, why are these books and IPs so popular at that time?\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: Just great. I love how this movie makes me fell, so magical. They made Hogwarts come true. All the details, the way they introduce the magic world to us muggles.\n",
            "Rating: , Review: reluctantly i read the first book after my sister and mother pushed how great it was. {and i'm not a big reader} i was hooked, it was so great. Rowling is an extremely talented writer. i couldn't get enough. i had to read all of the books. and they never let me down, they were all wonderful.\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: I loved this movie. There were a few jumps in the story I didn't care for but understand why they're there. This is by far the best FANTASY(not SCI-FI) movie made to date. I like the idea that it follows the book rather closely. Not many movies in the Fantasy field do that. LOTR is good too but lacks the action Harry Potter shows.\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: A very good movie, I should say, although, I think the book was written more for TV series. Because so many interesting things are omitted in the movie - it's simply impossible to put all that stuff into two and a half hours. I liked the book a lot. It is written in a very interesting way and, actually, in the movie the casting is really great! Well, I imagined Ron a little bit different, but Harry is perfect and the twins are great. I also liked the different from the book ending, but also interesting. I think this movie really worth seeing!\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: Spoiler Advisory:  I describe details of several scenes, to make points about character development, mostly.  But I do not reveal any significant plot elements. Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is a wonderful movie.\n",
            "Rating: , Review: I will admit that I was a non-believer.  I thought all this \"Harry Potter\" hype was just nonsense.  I never read the books, and I refused to see the film when it came out.  Non-conformist, you see.  Now, yesterday I saw \"Harry Potter\" for the first time.  And the second, third, fourth and fifth. I was AMAZED. A genuinely good movie, which means the books have got to be great!  I now, (a year late) have \"Harry\" fever, I have even developed my own little crush on Daniel Radcliff - a boy 6 years younger than I.  What is the world coming too?  Having seen the film, without reading the books, I can say I loved it, no bias. I am able to compare it to Wizard of Oz with a clear conscience.\n",
            "Rating: 9, Review: You can't compare this movie with J.K. Rowling's book, because there are many scenes missing and it hasn't got enough depth by far. But I still think it's a wonderful movie with great graphics (well...apart from that horrible centaur) and excellent actors. Best of all is ALAN RICKMAN!: 'Mr Potter......our new celebrity...'. I could watch that scene over and over and over again! His portrayal of Snape is brilliant, awesome, outstanding...there isn't a strong enough word. Nobody could have fitted more perfect for that role. It's a pity he has such little screen time, but hopefully there'll be more Snape-scenes in the upcoming movies! I give this movie 9 stars out of 10. I think it's fantastic to see the world of magic on the screen, although the book is much better.\n",
            "Rating: 8, Review: Being a fan of the harry potter book series I have to say that this is one of the better films to watch, it's the one that is the closest to the books. While the acting of younger generation leaves a little to be desired, they found an experienced adult cast. The most memorable actor-to-character would have to be Dumbledore. He was, by far, the best choice for his character, playing out the important scenes as only Dumbledore would, with quiet enthusiasm he more or less brings this film to a peak. Director Chris Columbus did a fantastic job on this one, with not a hair out of place, so to speak. He kept to the books, as far as one can when going from book to movie. I personally was sad to see him go in the third installment of this movie line. The landscapes are believable, the special effects were up to date, and the cast was memorable. The only reason I gave this an 8 out of 10 was because of some of the more obvious mistakes, Harrys scar switching sides, Dudly Dursleys hair was not blonde as it was in the books, some things were left out that wouldn't have added any time onto the final outcome of the movie. Obviously they can't add all of the aspects that the book brings to life but they could have tried a little harder, I mean c'mon, Lord of the rings was only 400 pages long and it was around 3 hours long, why couldn't they have taken the 300 or so pages and let it go on a little longer. All in all this movie is one of the best of 2001, I would recommend it to everybody, Harry Potter book fans or not.\n",
            "Rating: , Review: Seeing this movie, I was sure that there was a glitch in the Matrix : How else could such a horrible movie earn such accolades, and global enthusiasm? It just defies explanation.\n",
            "Rating: 8, Review: I am an absolute huge fan of the Harry Potter books. I was always on the edge of my seat just waiting for what would happen next. Its an addicting book, and I can't wait until the next books comes out.\n",
            "Rating: , Review: There isn't much that was left out here, but therein lies the problem, isn't it?  I know many avid harry potter fans, and they can't seem to put a finger on why they didn't like it, they just didn't!  This film is almost completely made up of scenes stripped from the book, which makes it even more irksome when certain minor things are left out.  It almost seems that this movie has no soul of its own, and manages to botch things at times: the awkward position of harry's scar, the way hermione looks, Professor Magonagoll's age, Harry's well kept and less than unruly hair, et cetera. Since everything is stripped from the book, the movie can barely afford to stray at all, making it irritating for fans to watch when something minor like that is changed.\n",
            "Rating: 9, Review: This is a very well made movie for all ages.  Even though it is geared more towards children this is so well written and directed that it will prove fun and intriguing for everyone.  The acting is even very good and we all know how difficult it can be to work with child actor ie. the half days the fact that they tire faster and can be less understanding of waiting for lighting etc.  This is a must see for all.\n",
            "Rating: 2, Review: I've read reviews for these films excusing the pathetic adaptations of the stories to film because \"they are for die hard fans who know the story already\". To know what is going on at all (especially in the later films) one would certainly have to have read the books. Even as kids movies they have left out so much of the fantastic novels, you would almost think that the same people who hate the books and ban them because of \"satanic teachings\" (HA!) produced these movies to dumb them down to the point of their own ignorance and stupidity.\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: I loved Harry Potter and Sorcerer's Stone! It was absolutely wonderful to read as well as to watch. One little thing though: In the movie scene which Professor McGonagall goes to fetch Wood, captain of the Gryffindor Quidditch team, and tells him that she had found him a new seeker, Harry (after seeing him flying through the air, retrieving Neville's Remembrall that Malfoy threw into the air), the classroom Professor McGonagall entered was the Defense Against the Dark Arts classroom, according to the book. But in the movie, the teacher was Professor Quirrell. In the book, it was Professor Flitwick teaching. Just thought I'd clear that up. Other than that, great book and great movie.\n",
            "Rating: , Review: First of all, I would like to point out that I read the books prior to watching the films.  From the moment I finished the Philosopher's Stone I loved the books however when I first heard that there were plans for a film I despaired.  And when I was finally persuaded to watch it a year after it had been released it confirmed what I already knew.  Films hardly ever live up to the books they are based on.\n",
            "Rating: , Review: The film was a brilliant start to the 7 films, but wasn't quite as good in certain places. I mean the troll scene and the Voldermort ones were excellent, but some of it just stated the obvious, as many people knew what was happening because they had read the books. Therefore I rate it 8. A little weird in places, but still, a brilliant film!\n",
            "Rating: 9, Review: This richly orchestrated visual escape to the wondrous world of Harry Potter was a success by no surprise. The movie makers did not attempt to depart from the well crafted story,the authors vision, nor did they sway from the enormity of the vision, artistic nuances intact, for that, the returns rolled in, which made sequels inevitable. \n",
            "Rating: 8, Review: I love the Harry Potter movies so much. It's tradition to re-watch them at least once a year. I can't put into words how mesmerizing it feels to watch and always feel that you're living in that world. I'm still waiting for my acceptance letter to Hogwarts lol.\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: I loved this movie....nice acting, directing, music, nice everything. It was great. And Chamber of Secrets and Prisoner of Azkaban are just as good.\n",
            "Rating: 3, Review: Many people have read all or at least the first of the Harry Potter series. Although the books seem more aimed at children, many adults also find them fascinating. As i will attest, the books ARE very interesting and i DO enjoy indulging in them. However, when the movie came out for the first book i was already skeptical. I mean: How can a movie be made out of such a complex plot with such mentally stimulating ideas? The first problem with the movie is the acting. I know that the actors are only kids, but there still are child actors that can do a good job. These children actors were ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE. Ron was the best character, and he was only mediocre. I personally would rather watch a movie with a bad plot with great actors than a great plot with terrible actors. I cant stress enough how bland all of the acting was; it was all monotone.\n",
            "Rating: , Review: Thank God the acting got better. Most of the lines sounded rehearsed, especially Daniel Radcliffe's. I'll give them some credit for acting simply because over the course of the next movies, they did get a bit better, but it's sad when I've only had 2 months of training in drama and I can act better than some of the actors in this movie.\n",
            "Rating: 6, Review: I recently re-watched this and i have to say it does strike me as one of the weaker Harry Potter films. Somewhat due to the period of time released and somewhat due to some of the story lines in this movie were a bit iffy in my opinion. I felt some of the stuff in here was slightly overacted from both Potter, Ron, Hermione, that doesn't compare to any of the other films. The start of the film was slightly weak for me, I got slightly bored in the first 40 minutes, it was elongated in parts. The general story when he got to the school was good for me, I have to say. The idea with the Forrest and early connection was a good one and I did really like the build to the end with the Chess game which was done so very well by all actors and effects made, best part in the movie. The ending as well was done very well which actually somewhat save the movie one could say. Overall a pretty decent movie saved by the last hour which was awesome. I would probably rate this about 6 to be honest.\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: Harry Potter is my favourite film series of all time.will never find anything better than Harry Potter.been watching these films for years and always will keep watching it. The films and merchandise is just amazing and the best.never in my life have I bought something so much than Harry Potter.also enjoy the fantastic beast films too.high recommend people watch Harry Potter and fantastic beast.can't wait for the new film of fantastic beast and waiting for cursed child film to be made.that's if it is being made.\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: i first of all didn't want to see it as i didn't like the book. My mate said come on come on you've gotta see it! Daniel is so hot in it so come on you'll love him! so i went and i did enjoy the film. after she sad wasn't he hot? i said no he wasn't. Draco Malfoy(Tom Felton) is a different matter! ever since she took me to see the movie i watched it 3 more times at the cinema and then my sisters BF had the DVD and so i watched that over and over and over again. hes now got the 3 disc box set with 1, 2 and 3. 4th one out 2moz and i cant wait! i have to thank my mate, Sam, for showing me this movie. if she didn't drag me to the movies then i think about now ill be doing something else not connected to harry potter at all! thanks mate xx\n",
            "Rating: 7, Review: This movie was amazing. However, if it was not based on a book, I would have given it a much better score. The movie did not follow certain major aspects of the book, including how Harry met Malfoy, and Voldemort flying instead of Slithering. The acting was amazing, especially for kids, but the camera angles were some of the worst in any big budget live action movie I've ever seen. The scenes on the train practically gave me whiplash because it appeared as though they could only show one character at a time. Watch the train scene again to see what I mean. Other that that, it was a pretty great movie.\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: I believe that the \"Harry Potter\" series needs no introduction, but just in case, this is the first movie in the eight-part series based on J. K. Rowling's, at this point classic, novels. It's about a young eleven-year-old boy whose parents got killed by an evil wizard Voldemort when Harry was a baby. After being raised (and mistreated) by his aunt and uncle not to know anything about the wizarding world, he learns of his true origin when he's admitted into the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. The rest is history.\n",
            "Rating: 3, Review: As a fan of the Harry Potter books, I went to the movie with great anticipation and expectation.  Many of of those expectations were met. The look of the Hogwarts school, the special effects, and the casting of characters are all superb.  The children were delightfully genuine, witty and not overly cute.\n",
            "Rating: 8, Review: One of the strange things about this movie is that although I left the cinema grinning from ear to ear, I did feel that it would not have stood alone without the books. Some people who have seen this movie but not read the books will undoubtedly say that they could not really become immersed in the experience properly - and this is very true. From the outset, I felt that many of the touches required familiarity with the subject material - the sorting hat and the stigma attached to the Slytherin House for instance, is something that is explained fully in the books, but not at all in the film.\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: How anyone could fail to enjoy this movie is beyond me. All the magic of the book was beautifully brought to life, and I was glad to be exiting the theatre into the darkness so that I could carry the magic with me a little longer, without being distracted by the mundane, ordinary world we live in. The director did a wonderful job of casting. Harry, Ron, Hermione and Hagrid were exactly as I imagined them, and all of the child actors did a superb job.\n",
            "Rating: 9, Review: I am 21, and I took my little brothers to see this, with not many expectations of enjoying it myself.  However, this movie was great!  A great story... the kids do a great job... the adults do a great job.  Not an all-time great movie, but a very enjoyable 2.5 hours.\n",
            "Rating: 1, Review: The movie was good, but unfortunately lacked the proverbial magic that the book had.  The director's cut was supposedly too long, and a lot of parts were cut out - perhaps this could have something to do with it.  Another example of Hollywood producers ruining a great book?  Perhaps.\n",

            "Rating: 8, Review: This is a movie which, simply, did not capture me.  \"Big deal\", you say? At under-18, I consider myself part of the film's target audience.  If there are others from this target group that share my views, than the movie has failed on a most fundamental level. Firstly, how on Earth does the drama take an entire year to unfold? Did the characters simply forget about these things for three weeks at a time, then pick up again? On this note, I was also given the impression of a year passing without *anything actually happening*.  The movie seemed to stretch towards its climax, and then kind of sputtered to a close. Secondly, there is another reason why I believe this movie has failed.  At its deepest roots, it is an advertisement for the book.  I was not exactly filled with a desire to read the novel when I exited the theatre.  In fact, if the score had not been done by John Williams I would have viewed my 2+ hours to be a waste of time.\n",
            "Rating: 5, Review: Chris Columbus really bungled this one.  Why he failed to see the myriad moments of the book that fall flat on screen escapes me.\n",
            "Rating: 9, Review: I must admit, I was very excited to see this movie.  My wife and I left work for a few hours to see the first showing today.  I was pleasantly surprised that the movie was quite good.  \n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: I'm over 50, and not a huge fan of wizards and sorcerers, etc, but this movie was terrific!  The effects were great, and the story was interesting. In a crowded theatre, not one person got up to use the can or buy junkfood during the whole movie.  And with my 50+ bladder, to have a movie keep me engrossed in it for over two and a half hours, it must be a pretty darn good flik.  And Harry Potter was!  I can't wait for the next one.\n",
            "Rating: 8, Review: I usually dont comment on films, I just give them my rating. However this film is a pure 2 and a half hours of fun. It has everything in a good proportion. It has humor, adventure, mystery and great effects. Its the first time I've seen a movie that has great special effects without the director and the producers letting all their hopes in the effects and drop other aspects of the movie (like they did in Star Wars Phantom menace). I had so much fun watching the movie that I went and bought the book so I have an opinion of how good they managed to transfer the feel of this great (I suppose) book.\n",
            "Rating: 9, Review: I never read any of the Harry Potter books, but found this to be a very entertaining movie, with charming characters, and very high production values.  I know it's supposed to be a children's book, but I'm over 60 and it kept up my interest from beginning to end!  I will probably buy the DVD and look forward to the next installment.\n",
            "Rating: 3, Review: Harry Potter is a long, dry crawl through a thirsty desert.  in the distance, dimly, you think you see a giant glass of water in the shape of Alan Rickman - only, when you get there, its not.\n",
            "Rating: 9, Review: Lovingly and lavishly done. If you are a Harry Potter or fantasy fan, by all means, see it early so that you can come back for seconds and perhaps even thirds. This one had our whole family talking for days on end and not just about the special effects either.\n",
            "Rating: 5, Review: I have never read any of the books and so I am a little tired of people comparing the two. As a film in it's own right I can't see what the fuss is all about. The story is charming yet predictable. The special effects leave something to be desired whereas the production design is excellent. Actors of the calibre of Rickman, Smith and Harris are wasted with small and unimportant scenes, and the rest of the film is dominated by children with mediocre acting ability. It was modestly entertaining but at 2 and 1/2 hours long it drags on with a wafer thin plot and marginally entertaining set pieces. I can see the appeal of the film to those who have read the book, but as a stand alone piece of film making it comes about par for the course.\n",
            "Rating: 3, Review: To put not too fine a point on it, this movie manages to destroy everything good about what was an adequate piece of children's literature.  The CGI is frequently ropey, all the money evidently having been spent on the Quidditch match.  The performances of the adult actors are going-through-the-motions as a rule, while among the young actors, only Rupert Grint as Ron Weasley and Sean Biggerstaff as Wood stand out as new talents.  Daniel Radcliffe is given virtually nothing to do as Harry other than grin or look puzzled as the occasion demands it, and Emma Watson's performance as Hermione Granger is so gut-twistingly awful as to spoil any entertainment that might otherwise have been obtained from the film.  Chris Columbus' direction is stodgy - you would have thought after Bicentennial Man that they would never have let him near a book adaptation again - and even the normally excellent John Williams manages to provide a score which is mainly unfitting and intrusive.\n",
            "Rating: , Review: Kids are finally reading something they seem to genuinely enjoy.  Why go and make a movie based on a great series?  Does Hollywood just want to completely fry children's brains?  It kills their imagaination.  The movie is telling them what Harry Potter's world looks like instead of letting them think for themselves.  Kids are going to stop reading because now they can just see the movie instead of actually taking the time to read the book.  I work in the schools, so I know this for a fact.  Half the kids who started the books have stopped so they can see the movie.  There's going to be a lot of disappointed kids out there because it's not going to be the same as they imagined it.  Don't get me wrong, it was a good movie.  But, it should not have been made.  Doesn't anyone agree with me? (rebecca1017@hotmail.com)\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: I can watch this film over and over. Story line, effects and casting are spot on. The only gripe, and I mean only. Is that after reading the book (saw the film first), the part where Harry and Hermione sort out the potions to get into the chamber with the mirror has been left out of the film. Pity, but I suppose bits had to be cut somewhere to keep the length down.\n",
            "Rating: 7, Review: Harry Potter was a fun movie, especially if you have children who are enchated by these stories.  But taking it on it's own as just a movie, without any pre-read book bias, it is a mediocre movie.\n",
            "Rating: , Review: I loved this film. I taped the story being read by Stephen Fry on BBC Radio (Boxing Day 2000) and have listened to it many times - usually when I'm going to sleep. So, (as I sleep quickly and soundly) there is lots of it I have not heard. The bits that I did hear gripped my attention so thoroughly and enjoyably that I was really looking forward very much to see the film. I LOVED every moment of it and found that the pictures that I had visulaised in my head were so much in line with  how they were portrayed in the film - it was almost like a rubber stamp. It is not a superficial liking but a very deep (to the toes of my boots) feeling  which has made me think that something very deep was being portrayed in the film/story.  I also heard JK Rowlings being interviewed - again on the BBC Radio - Desert Island Discs; her choice of music also resonated with me. So, I think this may not be merely  a single personal response but quite possibly be a wider and more general(and really quite precious) one.\n",
            "Rating: 9, Review: It has been stated in many different publications that because of time and WB's heavy hand a good 25% of the movie had to be cut that was filmed.  I feel since there was over 4 hours of film, and having to cut it down to 2 and 1/2 hrs the film was very good, I can not give it a 10 (until the DVD comes out, maybe then I can change my vote to a 10 from a 9) I do feel some very important scenes were left out, but after I see the DVD I will be happy.  I just feel that hopefully when the DVD comes out all of the scenes with be there.  In the different publications, it has been stated that the DVD will have all that was filmed.  There were a few things that upset me that weren't in the film, but not enough to make me tell people not to go see the film. All of the actors were wonderful and the casting was perfect.  I have read each of the books 2 or 3 times and I am not a 8 yr old, (I am 26, no kids) and I hoping that if we the fans make enough noise, maybe we can force WB's to do what they need to do, make a 4 hr or longer film with an intermission, movies use to have them, so why can't we have them again.  If you don't want to anger your true fans (the kids) you will understand that the film needs to have everything, not just the high points. One last thing, where was the Sorting Hat's song?  Will it be in the DVD? Great film, left a bit too much out, but still beautiful and a wonderful way to forget about today's problems (for 2 & 1/2 hrs)! I plan on seeing it again next weekend.\n",
            "Rating: 7, Review: Really not a bad attempt, and faithful to the book. One wonders what a director of some finesse might have done with this. A bit ham-fisted, and a little too much child-like wonder for the cameras...certainly not unenjoyable, but not captivating either.\n",
            "Rating: 9, Review: When I went to see this movie I went with 2 pre-teens and 2 over 70s. We all came out raving (Although one of the over 70s blames Harry Potter for sore hips for a month.) The special effects were great and the cast were perfect. J. K. Rowling's input shows as the film is mostly faithful to the book. An enjoyable outing all round and one I recommend.\n",
            "Rating: 7, Review: I should start by saying I am an absolute Harry Potter nut and so the film carried a huge weight of expectation.  It didn't disappoint.  The film includes stunning renderings of all the key scenes, wonderfully acted by an obviously caring and dedicated team.  The scenery and effects are stunning and fill you with a sense of wonder I haven't felt since I was a kid. Diagon alley, platform 9 3/4 and Hogwarts are all straight from J.K. Rowlings descriptions and were just how I pictured them.  The set pieces of the quiditch and chess match were fantastically exciting and added pace to a film that could have lagged (its 2 1/2 hours!).  The acting was uniformly superb.  Maggie Smith is brilliant as the strict yet caring McGonagal, Richard Harris adds the perfect sense of weght to Dumbledore and Snape is made suitably menacing without being camp by Alan Rickman.  The kids are brilliant, Rupert Grin and Emma Watson making Ron and Hermione their own, with only one line sounding corny from either.  Dan Radcliffe is good as Harry but would I feel have benefited from a bit of voice to camera naration to explain his feelings.  A mention should also go to Sean Biggerstaff as Oliver Wood, who is great when guiding Harry through quiditch and performing heroics in the Gryfindor goal.  Undoubtedly the star of the show though is Robbie Coltrane's Hagrid, he shows a full range of emotion from rage at the dursleys to caring ad sensitive with Harry.  He also gets the best comedic momments throughout the film.\n",
            "Rating: 8, Review: The soundtrack was excellent and the authors believeable. But something was lacking, a bit indefinable as to what. Maybe I've read the book to much so miss what was left out. A movie can never be as good as the book but this came close.\n",
            "Rating: 1, Review: I gave it a 1 in an attempt to counterbalance the idiots who probably gave it a 10 just because it's Harry Potter.  In truth I'd give it a 6.5 or so. It was a little boring...  The books, or at least the first one, which is the only one I had the will to read, sucked, because they're incredibly childish.  The movie is better simply because it moves much faster than the boring, drawn out books.\n",

            "Rating: 6, Review: \"Harry Potter and Sorcer's Stone\" is a adventure, family and fantasy movie directed by Chris Columbus and was produced in 2001 in the USA. It is 2h 32min long. The most important characters are Harry, Ron and Hermine starred by the actors Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson. The film tells the story about the 11 years old Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) how find out he's a wizard. In Hogwarts the magic school he leans more about his past and fight with his friends Hermine Granger (Emma Watson) and Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) aganst the evil.\n",

            "Rating: 9, Review: I saw the film last night and can say that this movie will be bigger than anything we expected.  I am a 21 year old college student who has read the books multiple times and enjoys arguing with people who say these books are just for children.  The books were awesome and I must say that the movie does not disappoint.  The key to whether or not these movies would be good was if the director stuck to the books.  He did.  And the result is the most visually impressive, magical 2.5 hours of film in a long time.  The sets are absolutely amazing and the detail of the backgrounds (the moving pictures and such) are perfect.  The kids are all great (in particular, Ron and Neville were awesome), but Snape is hands-down the best cast.  My only complaint (and the reason the film did not receive a 10 from me) was some of the omissions that the director did decide to do.  Of course the director can't put in everything, but I felt that some elements that the book had would have made the story stronger.  The most glaring omission (in my humble opinion) was eliminating the meeting of Harry and Draco in Diagon Alley. In the book, that scene sets the tone for their relationship far better than the non-subtle way in which the movie does it.  Also, there is simply a feeling of anticipation that the book broadcasts; the movie can't compete. But the movie succeeds in its intentions.  The world of Harry Potter exists in more than just our imaginations now.\n",
            "Rating: , Review: Though Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone was a very entertaining movie and extremely faithful to the book, it did leave a little to be desired. The movie was two and a half hours long, and oftentimes I found myself thinking, \"alright, alright, get onto the next part!\" I had read the book, but ages ago, and I barely remembered any of it, so I don't think my knowledge of the story was very responsible for these feelings.\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: When I read the first Harry Potter book six months ago, I felt that I was reading something very special.  Indeed, an entire generation of children are growing up with something that is so wondrous and exciting, that it pales anything like it to date.  This film captures the magic of the books beautifully.  From John William's magical score, to the fast-paced Quidditch match, to the 4-star cast, this film IS Harry Potter, realized as best as humanly possible.  The trio of child actors portraying Harry, Ron, and Hermoine have perfect chemistry.  The supporting players, Maggie Smith, Richard Harris, Richard Griffiths, and especially Alan Rickman are perfect. The one casting that just blows my socks off is that of Robbie Coltrane playing the role of the giant Hagrid.  Coltrane has fun with this role, making Hagrid a perfect mentor/guide for Harry Potter as he enters this new, magical world.  Chris Columbus has done a terrific job creating this world, which could easily have been watered-down and lost in budget cuts. Excellent film.\n",
            "Rating: 6, Review: Given that they set out to make a film of the book, this is about as good as it could be. The cast are well-chosen, the scenery and effects eminently appropriate.\n",
            "Rating: 3, Review: The story of Harry Potter could have been brought to life through the magic of cinema. Unfortunately, that was not executed. The pacing of the film is extremely slow, which makes me wonder how a 6-year old child would be able to sit still for two and a half hours straight when I couldn't do it. Another thing I questioned is that the movie title includes the Sorcerer's Stone...yet, the stone isn't even mentioned until the middle of the movie. When Harry becomes a seeker and plays in his first game, we are excited and interested by the quick and useful cuts. Yet as the game is over...we are left unfulfilled, once again. About ten minutes later, six people walked out of the theater. This continued throughout the movie. By the end of the film, there were approximately 15 people left, out of 25 or 30. On a positive note, the special effects used in the film were very good as well as some of the visual aspects. If there is a sequel to this film, I hope that it will include some excitement, lose the turtle-paced conversations and cuts and include something to keep the audience enticed.\n",
            "Rating: 9, Review: Harry Potter and The Soccer's Stone is directed by Chris Columbus, and stars Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint. The story: I love how the film always gives the audience a sense of mystery to the audience, always posing the question, who really wants Harry dead? Is it really Snape? What are the three headed dogs really guarding? The way we are introduced to Hogwarts is absolutely brilliant, everything about the place makes me want to get my own letter from Hogwarts- except I am a little bit to old now for such a miracle... The characters that we are introduced to were great casting picks, Daniel Radcliffe is absolutely perfect for Harry Potter, as is Emma Watson for Hermione, and Rupert Grint for Ron. But a character which really shines for me has to be Snape, and by the way, RIP Alan Rickman, you were most definitely hands down the greatest Snape we could ever have for this role. The way he talks is so grim and contradicting, and this really helps by having him being perfectly casted for the role, as he is a pertinent part of the storyline, the one who we really believe might actually be the villain of all this. And because that is cliché that he would be, as a viewer, we are sucked into Harry, Ron, and Hermione's assumptions. So, Alan Rickman as Snape was absolutely magnificent.\n",
            "Dumbledore, played by Richard Harris, really brings the wisdom to the table with his character, his voice of so much relaxation. But I never really saw this as the Dumbledore who could duel with Voldemort, so while this Dumbledore was perfection when it came to the comforting smile, and heart-warming nature of Dumbledore, I think that's where the other Dumbledore shined the most. But nevertheless, this is not a gripe, as he was done so perfectly in the suiting of this film. The cinematography in the film is so dazzling and vibrant, which is so suiting for this film. The score by John William is such a mesmerising score, giving the film a tone, which really helps film to feel light, but also in the film's darkest moments, not light, but never to daunting or malicious, which really would not suit the film at all. The theme of friendship in this film is also very strong, as this movie really bands the three together. To see these three meet each other on the Hogwarts's Express for the first time is magical on so many levels, because the evolution of these characters is unforgettably well crafted. Now, this film is not without any flaws or gripes. The first part of the film is trying to set up the universe of Harry Potter, and the world building aspect of the film is absolutely phenomenal, but however, does take a long time to do so, especially as there are still seven films to come in the series. When we have been introduced to Hogwarts, and its magical delights, and its characters, when it stops world building, this is a point in the film when it can't help feeling like it's dragging slightly. But when the film hits another climax such as the troll, Quidditch match scenes, the film stops dragging. Talking of the Quidditch match scenes, they haven't aged as well as they could of, but back in the day, the CGI in it was extraordinary. Funny what film has evolved to today. This is really a very minor gripe, but the film does have dragging points throughout its run time, as while this film thoroughly entertaining, it also has so much to set up. The finale of the film is very engaging, as this is where all the mystery without the film is wrapped up. The sequence where Harry flies through the swarm of keys is such a fun sequence. If any of the sequences in the final act of the film was the most memorable before the twist of the film is revealed to us, it would the chess scene. It's such a clever link back to Ron and Harry's game of chess earlier in the film. By the way, poor Ron, your eye rolling meanness during the first act of the film to Hermione can now be very well overlooked. The twist of movie is so great for the first time, and never really get's old for me. Plot twists from this movie really do become part of the gold standard of Harry Potter films, and I love it. Anyhow, through multiple watches of the film, I found at least, that you can see that Quirrell does seem a times a bit suspicious, and that clever little hint is a masterful piece of filmmaking to me. But when you find out it was Quirrell for the first time, the twist in the film really get's you. The first look at Voldemort is interesting, but he's not really the version of the character who sparks it for me, but of course, I'll be talking about the version who is so very well cast in good time (my next review of the next movie), and boy, does he provide!\n",
            "With that, Harry Potter and The Soccer's Stone is a wonderful look at the world of wizardry and fantasy and is so very nostalgic and memorable. I'm going to give it an A-, and as a Star Ranking, that's a well-deserved solid 9/10.\n",
            "Rating: , Review: I was so thrilled with the film version of _Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone_, that I went to see it four times.  I am an avid reader of J.K. Rowling's momentous book series and I was pleasantly surprised at how well the film adhered to her books. From a technical perspective, the sets were straight from heaven.  Diagon Alley, the aerial view of the Hogwarts Express speeding through the green countryside, Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, it all took my breath away.  The costumes also deserve a mention here as a plethora of colors and textures came to life in the Diagon Alley scene and, also, the school uniforms and dress of the faculty at Hogwarts were just as I had imagined them. The acting was flawless.  Kudos to the kids, especially: not an element of Macaulay Culkin among any of them.  Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson embodied Harry, Ron, and Hermione to perfection.  Robbie Coltrane, Dame Maggie Smith, Richard Harris, Warwick Davis, Ian Hart, Zoe Wanamaker, Fiona Shaw, Richard Griffiths, and absolutely everyone else simply *were* their characters.  Oh, and Alan Rickman. . . I could tell he knew more than I did about Severus Snape's character; his performance was free from all blemishes and far surpassed my expectations.  The supporting roles filled by Verne Troyer, John Cleese, and John Hurt, among others were delightful additions to a leviathan work of cinema. I was tremendously impressed with the film's attention to detail and its strict adherence to the books.  I felt that such faithfulness made it a truly successful endeavor and I for one was greatly appreciative of such an homage.\n",

My favourite character is Harry, because he is kind, but he hasn´t got a eazy live. He must be very brave to fight Voldemort. I love this film, because it is very thrilling.\n",
            "Rating: 8, Review: ...but once again, not as good as the book. It took me a while to get into the movie, as they omitted details here and there, but the movie cannot be 5h long either. I understand they had to chop somewhere, and to leave details behind they did! Once you've passed that barrier of comparison, it is not bad at all, well done. A bit disappointed with Voldemort, did not expect to see him like that. I was expecting a deeper evil look. Overall a good movie...\n",

Whiklst i think it was a different kind of story than the boo portrait\n",
            "Rating: 9, Review: To get the main question out of the way, is the film as good as the book ? No, but it only falls short by the slightest of margins. To describe those margins would be to give away plot points. So I won't. Personally I don't think any film could completely capture Ms Rowling's imagination, invention, characters and \"just one more chapter\" writing! Whilst I feel the film deserves every success, the books should not become a mere spin-off of the film(s). The film(s) are most definitely a by-product of some wonderful books!\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: Harry Potter is by far the largest craze in the history of fiction. There is not a person on this Earth over the age of 5 who does not know what a muggle is or what a Fizzing Whizbee is. Well, maybe a few, but they all know the name 'Harry Potter.'\n",
            "Rating: 6, Review: Harry Potter was an okay movie. It was not a particularly good movie. All of the atmosphere from the books was just plain missing... It was a faithful plot rendering, but it was not gripping. You don't get emotionally wrapped in what happens, and you just don't care what happens to these people. If you've already read the books, then Harry et al. already mean something to you, so it's okay-- but if you haven't, you're in for a yawn. The movie was also lacking a lot of the books' wit... presumably because they couldn't fit anything else in.\n",
            "Rating: 9, Review: The movie was generally ok, but it seemed as though they had erased lots of the movie out: but it still seemed far too long. The cast was good as Robbie Coltrane pulled the act of Hagrid off very well, as did the children.\n",
            "Rating: , Review: I must admit I approached this film with fear in my heart, directed by Chris \" bicentenial man\" columbus Shudder! and staring unknowns, but I was proved wrong the film stayed true to the book ( although cutting scenes) and all actors involved were top notch, although Alan Rickman was as camp as a row of tents. Some people may come away ( if they haven't read the books) dissapointed that the film meanders without a real plot, but those who've read the Philosiphers stone will know that this is the character film, it introduces you to the people. Then the chamber of secrets throws you into plot driven story. God bless Chris Columbus for not trying to mould the irst book into a typical \"film\" narrative, you need to be introduced to Harry, Ron, Hermione slowly to appreciate who they are. Roll on the Chamber Of Secrets!\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: This has been the best movie I've seen all year.  My children and I eagerly awaited this movie.  I commend the makers of this movie - they stayed with the book which made this a very exciting movie to see.  For my children (two boys ages 8 and 13), it was like seeing a book come to life. They immediately came home from this movie and went straight for book two, again. I highly recommend this movie to all families of ALL ages.  It is a bit longer than most movies at approximately 2.5 hours, but you don't realize you are there for that long as the movie will have you completely engrossed in it.  We sincerely hope they will make a movie of each of Ms. Rowling's books and eagerly await the next movie in this series. Kudos!\n",
            "Rating: 4, Review: My son and I went to see Harry, and we were both disappointed with the movie.  The direction and script writing were poor, along with some of the acting.  The move missed a lot of the little details that were so important in the book (For example, the letters coming addressed to the different locations where Harry Potter was moved to in the house, and the dragon bit also was very weak).  Overall, the story seemed to rush through the development to \"get to the chase\".  I felt indifferent to the Harry Potter character, and annoyed with him sometimes, remember the Home Alone star? Furthermore, the music seemed very awkward and sporadically placed.   It's too bad that movie creators are lazing about and opting for special effects and no imagination! The director really missed the magic of the books, and I hope next time they find a more imaginative director and scriptwriter.\n",
            "Rating: , Review: I have not read the Harry Potter books. I generally enjoyed the movie, but a lot of things made no sense to me. Why was the stone removed from the vault? How did Flamel lose the stone? Was Voldemort or the stammering teacher actually Flamel? If not, then why mention Flamel is going to die once the stone has been destroyed? Why have an elaborate system of defenses and booby-traps (Fluffy, the vines, the giant chess game, the flying keys, etc.) to protect a stone that just appears in your pocket, anyway? I assume those defenses are to protect the stone from bad guys, but where is the stone hidden? The movie does not make that clear. Why was the mirror, easily accessible before, suddenly moved by Dumbledor to this hard-to-access place? Why would kids be punished with a detention (which means locked up, not set free!) to the dark forest where evil lurks, and death is almost certain? Isn't that like putting someone on death row for going 45 mph in a 25 mph zone? In Quidditch, why even bother with putting the balls through the hoops if all you need to do is catch the little glitch ball to win the game? Why is the wand Harry gets so special?---he almost never uses it, anyway! Why is there such an inexplicable gap in the film near the end . . . where Harry, having recovered the stone, suddenly finds himself in bed. Who found the kids? Was Harry taken back unconscious? Did they run out of movie film? Why did Harry have a lightning bolt scar on his forehead? It is not explained how it got there, or why. Why must the giant chess game be commanded from the knight's horse, thus putting Weasely in danger? How do the chess pieces move around, considering all the rubble on the board?  And a million more questions!\n",

            "Rating: 10, Review: If u didn't read any of the books especially the first one in this rivetting series then the movie probably wasn't as good for you as it was for someone who was already familiar with what the difference between Gringotts and Hogsmeade were. I know that when i went with my family my parents kept asking me questions about what everything was and when all the words meant. After coming back from the movie my father was inspired to start reading the books. I have read them all and thought they were wonderful, I cannot wait for the next one this coming summer and i'm also anticipating the next movie. J.K.

            "Rating: 10, Review: When you talk about magic, you need to have some limitation to make the audience interesting. In this movie, it's mostly about how you pronounce it. Other wizards can do it without saying the spell. Another reason why I like this movie is because of Harry, Hermione and Ronald's friendship and bravery towards dangerous circumstances, especially in the final scene where Harry courageously defeated Professor Quirrel. The ending is also lovely where Harry said goodbye to Hagrid. Overall this is a great movie for Harry Potter fans to watch. 👍\n",

            "Rating: 10, Review: i'm a 23 year old guy and was forced to read the first book by my girlfriend. After that I read the other book willingly to say the least. Amazing charactors and story although the first book was a bit predictable (which obviously made the movie the same). I really don't think the movie stood up to the book though. A lot of things seemed rushed. Like all of a sudden the Dursley's were in a shack on an island?!! Of course I knew how they got there, but I can only imagine what a first time harry potter fan would think. They didn't show how the Dursleys were \"a little nice\" to Harry after getting back home. The Centaur scene also was a bit rushed. I know if they did it right along with the book the movie would be like 4 hours long but a little explination was needed at a few points. All in all if the movies are anything like the books at all they will just get better and better. The special effects, although not ILM, were a lot better than I was expecting even after seeing previews. The child actors were decent considering most of them haven't really had all that much experience. I should think that the acting department will get quite a bit better as the children have a bit of experience under thier belts and probably a few acting coaches. Hermione's lines seemed wierdly timed and Harry reminded me of countless school plays. Ron's charactor was my favorite, plus he got all the good lines. \"You're scary, do you know that? Brilliant, but scary.\". All in all I had a great time. The theatre I saw it in was ghetto as can be seeing how all the theatres in my area are completely sold out for every showing for the next week. I look forward with bated breath to see the second installment fo the Harry Potter movies.....as well as The Lord Of The Rings in a month! Pretty good time for movies right now.\n",
            "Rating: , Review: My main criticism of the film was that it shouldn't have been made at all. Rowling's books are extremely imaginative and filled with small details and philosophy, none of which transfer well to the screen.  Fitting a long book such as The Sorcerer's Stone into the constraints of a movie is naturally going to require massive cutting of a story that relies on its buildup to create the magical world.  Personally, my favorite character was Dumbledore, who's mysticism, quiet brilliance, and idiosyncrasies of personality and philosophy come to life in the books.  In the movie, however, nearly all of his interesting lines are cut, and his character is almost fatally degraded. Hopefully, this will be replaced in the later films, but I think the Sorcerer's Stone would have retained more of Rowling's childlike quality if he hadn't been so heavily edited.  Even through this, however, the adaption worked relatively well, considering the nearly impossible task.  The characters, too, were well done, though I think Harry should have shown a little more surprise at his new surroundings (an important part of the realism of the books, which is overlooked in the movie, probably because of time constraints).  All thoughts of plot and characters aside, the commercialization of Harry Potter sickens me: nothing dulls the magic of such a book more than seeing it everywhere.  Bill Watterson, creator of Calvin and Hobbes, understood this perfectly, and therefore didn't allow his syndicate to license his creation.  Rowling should have done the same thing, and allowing the story to be made into a movie only makes it worse.  Harry Potter has become a catch-phrase for the over-commercial culture, and this commercialization is destroying it.  Still, even though it's principle is flawed, the movie was allright.\n",

            "Rating: 9, Review: Ron and Hagrid steal the show and Daniel Radcliffe is a great Harry.  Chris Columbus and the crew do about as well as anyone could have done with only having 2-1/2 hours to tell the story.  I would have loved to have seen a lot more character development, setting of moods and use of supporting characters.  But the only way to do that would be to turn it into an eight hour movie.  Personally, I would LOVE to see that eight hour version.  I wish he would have made it 8 hours.  Professor Snape and Draco do very well, as well.  Emma Watson as Hermione is an absolutely beautiful young woman and does a good job.  I also liked Fang.  I thought the special effects were very good and the sets are incredible.  My favorite part of the movie is the chess game.  My only complaint would be that it's choppy.  It doesn't flow very well.\n",
            "Rating: 9, Review: Well the movie is simply nothing compared to the book, and most of the parts are not present. So if you've read the book, see the movie else it's not worth it. If you've read the book, the movie is very nice as you can relate to it.\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: I have four younger sisters, all huge Potter fans and they loved this film. An adult could find a few minor faults with this film but the kids will go mad for it. The story stays very true to the book and the all star cast of veteran Brit actors and the young unknowns are all superb. Take your kids to see this film NOW !\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: Some of the scenes in this movie was INCREDIBLE.  I was not expecting the quidditch match to look so amazing.  The special effects could have carried this movie alone.\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: No matter how much you watch Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, it will NEVER get old! It's storyline and connection to the audience through the books and the actors is very important it is portrayed perfectly throughout the movie. The connection the characters of trio are supposed to have. Yes, some scenes aren't there from the book, but still Harry Potter is a world of magic, magic it has brought to us and our lives. Harry, Ron and Hermione figure out that they work together and keep each other alive. Which broadens their friendship into something they will learn to call family. Literally! I love the magic that book 1 and movie 1 has brought to our very muggle world.\n",
            "Rating: 8, Review: Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (the correct title, ahem) was much anticipated by myself, being an avid fan of the books.  I was looking forward to so much - what would the uniforms look like?  What would Quidditch be like?  I have to say that I was reasonably pleased.\n",
            "Rating: , Review: Harry Potter has been hyped as potentially the biggest movie ever. Like many but not all \"biggest movie ever\" blockbusters, the movie doesn't live up to a fraction of the hype. The story is centered around an orphan who has magical powers and lives with his aunt and uncle. The movie is visually stunning but leaves the viewer emotionally disconnected. This is a characteristic common of all \"biggest movie ever made\" type films, all multimillion dollar special effects and no real story or compelling characters.  There is no definite antagonist that interacts with Harry. The viewer is given very little information about Harry's origins. It seems like a bunch of short stories glued together. In addition there is no emotion or no heart tugging in this film. Its certainly no E.T.! I felt that the title role was miscasted, Daniel Radcliffe didn't display too much enthusiasm and seemed too robotic at times. Its like vice versa of Haley Joel Osmont in A.I. where he's a robot named David but Haley plays the role so well we feel for his character. Its difficult to make any connection with Harry and care what happens to the character. The movie just meanders around. Its not unentertaining its just that with all the technical feats, the movie's artistry is sorely missing. I would give the film a C+, its entertaining for a while but totally forgettable. If you're under the age of 12 its a B+.\n",
            "Rating: , Review: Finally I watched the movie! Probably this is the most awaited movie of this year.. and I'm generally satisfied after I watched it.\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: I found this movie to be very faithful to the book. The special effects were very realist and especially the people, in those paintings, we could see moving. But I wouldn't let some toddlers and little kids see this movie since there`s some scary scenes. But still, it`s an excellent movie made for anyone.\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: Harry Potter is destined to become a cinematic classic. Easily the best film released this year--edging out my previous favourite, The Others--the adaptation of J.K. Rowling's bestseller is relentlessly faithful, but nevertheless, consistently entertaining and fresh. With a beautifully imaginative story, some of the most wonderful character acting by both young talent and the seasoned elite, and an overwhelmingly eyepopping art direction that is perfectly atmospheric and magical--Harry Potter does absoultely everything superbly.\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: This is a one of a kind movie that will not be forgotten for a long time to come. Harry Potter is played by Daniel Radcliffe, witch is the ultimate Harry. No sole on earth could have acted as well as he did. Hermonie was a well chosen actor. As for Ron, His personality matched his part, but he was suppose to have freckles. But in the movie he did not. Still, The special effects rock! The sound rules! And I would recommend this movie to any one who loves an adventure!\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: I saw the film, and all I can say is that I was not disappointed when I came out of the theater. The actors did a superb job in capturing the personalities of the characters in the book. And the film itself was well done because it captured to mood of different parts of the story.\n",
            "Rating: , Review: I was a bit worried about this film. Having read all the books, when i heard the film was being made i thought that it would ruin them, no way could they create harry's world completely by the book...But i was proved wrong. I went to the preview of this great film and sat with a huge grin on my face throughout the entire 2 1/2 hour running time, which flies by!The film stays true to the book, there are a few bits that they leave out but it is as close as a movie could be and doesnt miss out anything too major. Harry Potter is exciting and jam packed full of amazing special effects-the cast are great, particularly Hermione as she is just how I imagined her to be. Overall this film rocks take everyone to see it now or you will miss out on one of the most entertaining family movies ever!!! *****(5/5)\n",
            "Rating: 7, Review: I hate being just about the only dissenting voice, but I was not overly impressed with Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (as it is titled in the UK).\n",
            "Rating: , Review: This is a very entertaining story about the education in wizardry of Harry and his friends and classmates.  Contrary to many I found nothing dull or dragging about any part of this movie, even the quiet parts (of which there were few).  One small quibble is that the game of Quiddich is not very clearly explained, though I was able to follow it when it was played. All in all, it provided thrills and suspense that even this adult could enjoy (though I haven't read the books), up to and including the truism that Not Everything Is What They Seem.\n",
            "Rating: 8, Review: I read all Harry Potter storys when i was 11. These books were the best choice for me, and I didn't want to watch the films because I was afraid to be disappointed . So, at 13 I enjoyed all these films and it was a good decision . The books will be always better for me always , but moves are really decent . The actors are really cool and attractive . I want to watch it again and I think, it will be classic for very long time . I recommend you to watch this film if you haven't done it yet . Byee:))))\n",

            "Rating: 5, Review: ***************WARNING, WARNING, WARNING!!!!!!***************** !!!!Contains spoilers!!!! Now before I start, I want to tell you that I'm a crazy Harry Potter fan, I've read all 4 books multiple times and was waiting anxiously for this movie to come out for months. I was sadly dissapointed. I know a lot of people loved the movie, even critics... but I found it lacked so much from the books. I know you're all saying:\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: This movie was incredibily faithful to the book.  This could be a downside, as they did have to cut alot out in order to make a movie of managable size. A few things were changed, but what was at least 80% of the book was there and followed faithfully.\n",
            "Rating: , Review: This is an amazing movie.Forget the critics you get to warm up to the characters.Even if you haven't read the books my uncle who hasn't read a single one enjoyed it.The cast is superb you actually feel like they are the characters come to life.Sets are dazzling as are the effects.There are not too many effects like overload.They're in all the right parts and forward the story.Simply good there are some negatives like too much being crammed in to fit the time period.\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: I NEVER go to the movies.  Just wait for PPV for the hot ones, or cable showings.  But, this one I had to see.  They were faithful to the story and cut judiciously.  I understand the minor changes in the plot and felt that it was very well done.  Casting was great.  Whether you read the book first and then see the movie, or vice versa, you won't be disappointed. \n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: I thought that I would be very disappointed in the movie after loving the books so much.  I was pleasantly surprised!  Some of the omissions in the movie bothered me and some of the character changes (Hermione was much too cute and kind of annoying, and where did Dumbledore's humor go?), but overall, I think it was a splendid adaptation.\n",
            "Rating: , Review: As a fantasy fan, I read the books on the recommendation of a teacher friend and found them delightful.  I had read many articles prior to the film release date and had a good feeling going in.  So far I have seen the film twice, the second time getting more details than the first.\n",
            "Rating: , Review: Great actors. Perfect casting for every role. I can not express how great Harry was! I hope we'll be seeing a lot from this new actor. I understand that they had to cut some of the parts to squeeze it in 2 1/2 hours, but they didn't have to twist up the plots? Whatever happened to the use of Hermione's logic at the end? What about the rest of the Quidditch matches? What about Dumbledore rescuing Harry from Voldemort? Lots of stuff were left out. Great special effects, but the centaur looked like it was straight out of a video game. I'd have o give it a 6 out of 10.\n",
            "Rating: 9, Review: My whole family really enjoyed the movie.  If you read the book, go into the move recognizing that they don't have time to include everything in the book and that there will require minor plot changes.  If you do this, the movie is great fun.  One note of caution:  there are several \"scary\" scenes which may be too intense for small children and I counted at least 3 \"minor\" uses of profanity.\n",
            "Rating: 6, Review: I missed a lot of the fuss about the books because I was in China so I dutifully worked my way through them - and found myself getting rather involved - they're nothing special but they're a good read.\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: I thoroughly enjoyed the movie adaptation of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone (Philosopher's Stone).  Perhaps the most telling proof I can offer is that I've never gone back to the theater to see a movie for a 2nd time .. until Harry Potter. I've seen it twice now, and may go back to see it again, just to \"experience the magic\".\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: Harry Potter is a terrific series of books, and the movie was a departure from them.  Well and good.  There was only so much time, after all.  The scene with Dudley in the zoo... fabulous!  Seamus blowing things up left and right... terrific!  Ron was... well... Ron.  Hermione was... well... believable as Hermione.  Harry was... well... outclassed by his comrades. Apart and aside from that, great performances by Uncle Vernon, if you can believe it, and Hagrid.  Snape also turned in a stellar performance.  I'm curious how people who didn't read the books thought of the film.\n",
            "Rating: 7, Review: this was a good beginning to the series, apparently meant to introduce the characters rather than tell a story.  all ingredients are present for the next one to be great, as long as it has a better story.\n",
            "Rating: , Review: This movie is very moving, funny and scary, which is a very good combination. Daniel Radcliffe, who potrays as Harry, has done a brilliant job indeed. Rupert Grint, who potrays Harry's best friend, Ron, has great lines and is very funny. Emma Watson, who potrays another of Harry's best friend, Hermione, made me irritated, which is good because you're suppose to be irritated! The adult actors are great. They're experienced and you can expect lots from them if you see the movie. I'm not ashamed to say this but I cried during some parts of the movie. It was so emotional and touching, and I laughed really loudly that the whole crowd followed suit when something funny happens. This movie is a must see--I'm giving it 5 stars.\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: a very good movie you must see it!!!!!!! it might have missed out on some scenes from the book. but its still great! i think J.K Rowling has done some really great books that must be put on the screen!!!\n",
            "Rating: 8, Review: London was shot by many movies , such as Harry Potter. Platform Nine and Three-Quarters is one of the famous site in Harry Potter. It is located in Kings Cross Station in Harry Potter series one \"The Sorcerer's Stone\". Kings Cross Station became famous because of Harry Potter. People want to experience the platform in person. Another site impressed me a lot is London Millennium Footbridge. The Voldemort army began to attack the wizards of the Muggle World. The London Millennium Footbridge was destroyed by the villain wizards flying in black smoke. As a result ,\n",

            "Rating: , Review: I really enjoyed this movie. They said in the papers that they dropped an extra clue into the movie about Harry's relation to Voldemort, which I have seen. I won't say what it was. I think the three main actors and actresses did a beautiful job playing their part. It's amazing how much they look like their set character. I would totally recommend this movie to people. If you have not seen this movie yet, do so now!\n",
            "Rating: 4, Review: I found this Harry Potter movie greatly overhyped. The result was a long, boring movie with a thin storyline. The plot is, even for somebody who has not read the book, way too predictable. Not nearly the movie I expected it to be.\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: I love reading books ever since I was a child and I enjoy movies just the same. As it goes, I was disappointed so many times when seeing a movie after reading the book it was based on. (There were very few exceptions.) I have also seen, end enjoyed, most (if not all) of the great movie phantasies created during the 20th century. And, I don't remember saying the word \"masterpiece\" about the movies too often.\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone is one of the best pictures of all time, but yes the best adaptation of all time. I saw it on november 29 (a day that I will never forget) and I camo out of the cinema because I was really surprised. I didn't expect it to be so escelent, I was a fan of teh books but I was afraid of the movie, but now I am also a fan of the movie. I went to saw it whit my familie (we were 12) and we all came out of the theater happy because this film cause that, happines. The movie has a magic, friendship, darknes and happines that is not usual in the films tha we used to see. I must sais that I was no dissapointed with the film but yes surprised. I think that this film is the best in something: adaptation, because I read the book for second time a week before it comes to theaters and I think that in the film they respect the book perfectly, so I put to Harry Potter an the Philosopher Stone a 10, so don't listen to the stupids that said that is wrong because you are losing a future classic.\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: I really loved this movie.  It wasn't exactly like the book, but it was totally different either.  It pretty much follows the book.  Daniel Radcliffe makes a perfect Harry Potter, and Emma Watson is the perfect Hermione, but Rupert Grint, all I can say about him is I don't think another actor alive compares to his preformance.  He is perfect!\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: This movie is the coolest movie ever.  I love Harry Potter, and the movie. Ron (Rupert Grint) is my favorite Character, and he did really good(And he's cute) I love the movie, it's a mixed feeling movie your sad, then your happy at the same time, IT'S the BEST movie YET!\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: I loved this movie!  I saw this movie before I read the book, and I thought it was absolutely wonderful.  I loved everything about it: the actors, the imagery, everything.  I have been reading a lot of other reviews of the movie, finding that most people didn't like it.  I think that most people are trying too hard to pick it apart instead of sitting back and enjoying it.  I can't imagine how they could have made it more perfect.  I have read the book since then, and I think that the movie followed it quite closely. After reading so many horrible reviews of the movie, and after reading the book myself, I wanted to see the movie again.  I saw it for the second time last night, and I STILL LOVED IT!  I don't think you have to be a kid to enjoy it either, as I am 21 myself.  I think you just have to have an imagination. 4 out of 4 stars.\n",

            "Rating: 10, Review: I would like to say harry potter is a great movie because it showed the innocence in a child very beautifully.GOD always wanted to man to be innocent so he gave man a  fortunate chance to be a CHILD  first then adult.just look at sheer INNOCENCE in harry potter.it takes any human mind into their fantasies, the dreams they use to see of wizards and win of good over evil.In GOD'S world innocence transcends logic and intelligence.FULL points to HARRY\n",
            "Rating: , Review: When I went to see Harry Potter in 2001, I was excited. Everyone was. When it ended, I was just as excited. But when I read the book again,   I realized that it wasn't as good as I thought it was. Okay, it's a good movie on its own, the acting is good, the sets and special effects are superb, and the Quidditch seen was awesome, but they strayed so far from the book that I can't believe they dare to call it faithful. A few characters(Dean, Neville, etc.) had almost no screen time. The running gags of \"I shouldn't a told yeh that\" and Seamus blowing things up got boring immediately. They say they couldn't put some things in because it would be too long. I understand. But maybe if they didn't add so much excess crap, they could squeeze those crucial scenes in. Another thing, by the latter half of the movie, Hermione was turning into a complete idiot, quite unlike the book. They didn't even bother with the scene where she solves the Potions puzzle. Good, but not great.\n",
            "Rating: 6, Review: After all the expectations how great the movie would be and how much money it would produce (as if this is the most important thing about a movie) I was very disappointed. The plot has holes and the story line switches for no reason here and there. The characters are not convincing and the relations are almost non-existing. And it's boring quite a good deal of the time. But there are virtues too - very beautiful pictures, nice visual effects and interesting and original events. And I guess for kids it's fun from time to time. The acting is also good and the young people are really nice. But anyway this movie was far from being what it was supposed to be - one of the greatest fairy tales ever filmed. Far from classic kids' fairy tales such as Neverending Story or Star Wars (episodes 4-6). So Can Watch It, But Not Very Good - 6/10.\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: I really did not want to see this movie.  I hadn't read any of the books and all the hype surround Harry Potter was a big turnoff for me.  However, I'm very glad I got talked into seeing it.\n",
            "Rating: 7, Review: Harry Potter and the Sorcerers  Stone, while having wonderful special effects, did not meet the praise that it has received from so many people. The actors and actresses weren't very believable, but i guess i should have expected that since it was their first time in a big movie.  Hopefully as they are in the other movies they will get better and better.  However, I still enjoyed the film very much.  The scenery, the special effects, and all of the witchcraft made up for the other not-so-good stuff.\n",
            "Rating: 5, Review: The casting is good. The castles are real. The kids are especially cute and good. The ghosts are fun. But the music seems recycled. The special effects are underwhelming. And the movie just does not seem to WORK. There's a lack of suspense & the enjoyable qualities of the novel would have transferred much better with some narration.\n",
            "Rating: 9, Review: He was a child; in fact, he was only seventeen on the day voldemort was actually defeated, and he had been carrying a lot of responsibilities that fate had imposed on him since he was eleven. The title of the chosen hero makes him strong, can only endure, growing up fatherless, being pointed at, risking his life to fight monsters every year, watching people around him die, and because he was chosen, he can't even complain.\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: And so the first novel of the children's fantasy series that author J.K. Rowling brought into the world is transformed to visual life for the big screen. Directed by Chris Columbus, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone stars Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter, an 11-year-old who has been living his life thus far with his Muggle aunt, Muggle uncle, and Muggle cousin. See, Muggles are humans that possess no magical abilities. Harry, on the other hand, has found that when he's excited or angry, he is able to do things of a sorcerous nature. One day a mysterious letter arrives, which the Muggle adults endeavor to keep away from him. Harry finally gets his hands on the letter, and discovers that he's been invited to attend a school of wizardry. And it's off to a magical world that he goes.\n",
            "Rating: , Review: I thoroughly enjoyed this film. However I expected it to be somewhat less than what it actually was due to the objections of religious groups about the films content and it's effects on children's behavioral patterns. All in all, I didn't see the film as being any more than a great work of fantasy, action, comedy, and horror all wrapped up in a movie for everyone to watch. There is something for everyone to enjoy. I would go see it again and will add this my collection.\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: Everyone, from people have not read the book to the ones who have, have marveled over this amazing spectacle of a motion picture. The acting and scenes are amazing and it stays very true to the book. It provides incentive if you have not read the book and encourages you to pick up the book and get with the rest of the game. See the movie, discover the magic that has touched the souls of millions.\n",

Kept everyone's interest.  I can not say anything bad about the film except now I have to wait for part 2 for 10 months so boo and hiss. I have now read all the books so far (4) and can't wait for the 5th book, the 2nd movie this November, and the DVD (May?).  Anyway EXTREMELY delightful movie so go see it.  Go Harry:)\n",

            "Rating: 7, Review: After hearing of all the records it came near to or broke, I was disappointed after watching it. The hype surrounding the movie caused me to go out and read the book. After reading it, I thought the movie would be great, but....it was just the book on screen. Not much to it, they used exact lines, etc. Lord of the Rings was based on the book, but it was so much better... Maybe it's because this movie was directed towards kids, but the movie was just boring. I didn't find the three-headed dog or wizard chess as exciting as it was in the book. And after reading it, you already know of the big surprise at the end. It's a good adaptation of the book, but the book surpasses it on so many levels...\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: Seeing this film makes me as giddy as a 12 year old! I, like many others, was a tad bit worried when I heard Chris Columbus was directing (being a major Terry Gilliam fan, especially), but I must say, Mr Columbus brought the book to life in a magical sort of way!  This movie is also great for filling in the seemingly endless gap between Harry Potter books.\n",
            "Rating: , Review: Oh. Yeh. OK. I've read the books 2 or 3 times the way through and have all of them. I've seen the film 3 times [little bruv has it on video] and I STILL think it's just a bad film. I'm sorry to all you fans of this but i would only give this film 3-4 stars. And those are for the special effects. Yes, the special effects are great! I loved the Quidditch Match where the people are flying around [except when D. Radcliffe appears again] and the CGI was brill.\n",
            "Rating: 7, Review: Whilst I'd obviously heard of Harry Potter I only read the books a couple of weeks before the film and read them all in a week - not a good idea as you spot the 'formulaic' aspects.\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: Warner Brother's depiction of Harry potter and the Sorcerer's stone passes the test! As anticipation built up for its debut in theatres, J.K Rowling's brilliant series was about to be loved by more than just its loyal readers. Now, everything entertaining and enjoyable about Harry Potter is accessible to viewers too. Eager fans and intrigued new ones all flooded movie theatres to get in on the new buzz! There were several scenes from the original book left out, but I wouldn't hold that against the producers as it probably conflicted with time issues. Either way, I thought the movie was a nice visual tribute to the book, despite the forever-present argument that movies don't do books must justice. After all, the fact that every kid in America knows who Harry Potter is is a true testament to its success. One thing in particular that I was highly fond of was the legitimacy of the characters emotions. For how fairy-tale like the story is, the movie did a really good job at avoiding cheesy lines accompanied by bad acting. In fact, the acting was so good I could make a real connection to the character's feelings. This movie is definitely worth seeing, 10 out of 10.\n",
            "Rating: 9, Review: Of all the Harry Potter movies that came out, the Sorcerer's Stone is by far that best. Having watched all the other films, I found that this movie interested me the most. The magic and atmosphere that was presented in this film blew my mind away. Seeing the magic for the first time was awesome. In the other films you kind of expect the magic that would be coming but because this is the very first movie, it was fun and entertaining to see the magic performed for the first time. Aside from that the plot and storyline helped to build up the other movies so essentially it is important. I highly recommend seeing this movie. It hooks you into the whole Harry Potter thing and from there on out, you'll want to watch it over and over again.\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: Before the movie was released on November 16th I had been a big Harry Potter fan and couldn't wait for the movie it come out. I watched in amazement as the wonderfully vivid writings of JK Rowling leapt of the paper and formed a delightfully magical motion picture.\n",

            "Rating: 9, Review: For being 2 and a half hours, this is the best they could have done.  Some of the minor characters and humor is cut down, but since it stuck to the main events, it is still great.  This is probably the best adaptation of a book that I have seen.  That does not mean that this movie is perfect though.  While much of the movie contains things that were in the book, there are things missing that I was looking forward to.  I know that they could not have put everything in here, but they could have made it just a teeny bit longer.  I was also disappointed by the special effects.  While all of them look spectacular, I was hoping that I wouldn't be able to tell that it was CGI they were using.  I was able to tell though.  That took away from the perfect 10 rating.  That aside, everything did look about right, from Diagon Alley to the Giant Chess Game.  This made for a great movie though, and I saw it a couple of more times in the theater, having enjoyed it so much.  I am highly awaiting the sequel, and from the trailer, it looks that it will even surpass this one.  I will always enjoy this movie, though, no matter how many times I see it, due to the fact that this is my favorite book series coming to life.  I gave it a 9/10 rating.\n",
            "Rating: 7, Review: I walked away from this movie unimpressed but not disappointed either. I think that the effects were good, the first view you get of the Hogwarts castle was great and the Quidditch match was interesting to watch, but that too many details, which would have made the movie more enjoyable, were omitted. Also, I wasn't too impressed with the kids' acting. For such a successful book series I think they could have done better casting for Ron and Harry, however I did like Emma Watson, the girl who played Hermione. Overall...I liked it, though. 7 out of 10 stars, maybe the next one will be better.\n",
            "Rating: , Review: Watching this film and watching another one is completely different, because you are not thinking \"Will I like this story?\" or \"What will come next?\". You are thinking \"Will this be as good as the book?\", \"Will the story be just the same?\", \"What will the director take off?\". For someone who has read the four books, I have to say that in the first time I saw the film I was very disappointed. I thought: \"Great story, great actors, great music, eveything to make a good film, and they did was this?\". I was disappointed because I thought that what it takes to love the book was not in the movie. Recently, I bought the tape and I saw it again, and again, and again. And my opinion changed. It's not as bad as I thought when I saw it the first time. The film tells the story in a great way, the actors are perfect and the music is fabulous. Also, the visual effects are spectacular (who can forget the quidditch game, the best scene in terms of special effects?). However, I still have the feeling that this film was made for those who read the book, and I can't help thinking that there is something missing there. Anyway, it's worth seeing. I give it 7/10.\n",
            "Rating: 7, Review: Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is the first of J.K. Rowling's magical series. This young protagonist starts out by living the muggle life with his aunt, uncle, and annoyance of a cousin Dudley, knowing very little of his mysterious and mystical past. It was his twelfth birthday when he started to receive letters from Hogwarts, inviting him to spend the next term as a new student of the wizard and witches academy. Hagrid, a wizard friend, comes and retrieves Harry from his horrific living arrangements to take him away. By this point in the 2001 film, director Chris Columbus does a fantastic job of drawing the viewer into the movie, though compared to the book doesn't do quite as fair in introducing Harry's background. Overall, Columbus does a great job in taking Rowling's work and turning it into an animated film, but there are minor differences in the plot that are left out that many might feel should not have been. Included are background, dialogue, and some scenes from the story that did a fantastic job in building a great story. Daniel Radcliff, the actor portraying Potter, makes a wonderful role for the part. He really gives a sense of character and admiration to the heroic role he plays. From his accent to his appearance, he characterizes is the perfect picture from the imagination. Robbie Coltrane, on the other hand, seems to be cheated out of a good part. The 6'1'' actor does a magnificent job portraying the enormous bearded Hagrid. He plays the dim giant very well, and certainly makes one see the Hagrid they imagine, thick accent included; but when it comes to dialog, Hagrid's character in the film is just lack-luster. The novel is perfect in personifying him, while the film leaves out lines and cuts out scenes that help make Hagrid as good as Coltrane could have potentially made him. Overall the acting and casting of the movie was excellently done and there are very few changes that could have been made to make it any better. The special effects in this film were superb. When looking at the time this movie was made, and seeing how realistic the flying and quidditch matches, the magical spells, and even the mystical creatures, it is hard to believe how great they turned out. The lighting in the film was a little dark and bothersome, but when looking at the setting and mysterious feel the film was going for, it is completely acceptable and understandable. The film work was well done. Though it could have used some work, Columbus did a great job in finding the best way to film these witches and wizards. Overall I rate the film a 7 out of 10 for a fun and exciting story, for kids and adults alike. Great acting, dialogue, and filming, and special effects that keeps the action feeling real. Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is certainly a film worth watching to any avid science fiction fantasy fan or just a general audience looking for some strange and mischievous fun. The next of the series is also something to look out for in the future!\n",
            "Rating: , Review: I went into Harry Potter expecting the 'masterpiece' that everyone else claimed it was. I came out with extreme disappointment. Harry Potter has been over-commercialised, the movie is just an excuse to make toys and bad Harry Potter official magazines, lollies, documentaries, stickers, diaries, pencilcases, etc. The acting by the main character, Daniel Radcliffe, is particularly bad, and there is no expressions. The plot develops too quickly, and within 10 minutes of Harry being in a wizardry school he is already learned in most areas of magic. Everything is rushed in the movie, and things are DEFINATELY not faithful to the book.\n",

The story does not follow the book exactly. I first saw it as a small kid and I was really impressed, and even though I have now seen better movies, my first \"wow\" still lingers.\n",
            "Rating: 9, Review: Harry Potter and the philosopher's/sorcerer's Stone is the first of 8 movies, and in my opinion it is the authentic one and properly also the best though the story in places differ from what is in the book it still captures all the aspects of the story in just the right way, or at least in a way that I at the time great Harry Potter fan could accept. I have more than one friend who didn't read the book but instead saw the film, and often that is the way to do it because the movie will never live up to the expectation you have from the book. Harry Potter and the philosopher's/sorcerer's Stone is not one of these movies if someone came up to me and asked should I read the book before seeing the movie so I don't miss things, or should I see the movie and afterwords read the book, or can I just see the film and understand everything that happens. I would tell them that for this book/movie you can do what you want the film is so good that you will miss almost nothing from the book and will be totally ready for the next film/book (although a few characters like Ginny Weasley didn't get a prober introduction in the first movie). I think overall the cast was great and really capture the people. I in particular loved Dumbledore that was the spitting image of Dumbledore as I saw him with a perfect mix of calm and commanding demeanor. There are a few things fans of the harry potter book might have wished they had put in there, but all in all this is a great introduction to the Harry Potter universe. It is not a perfect move and I will there for not give it ten but it is close to perfect representation of the source material and for that I give it a 9/10.\n",
            "Rating: 2, Review: This movie was clearly an attempt at making a quick grab for the Christmas buck when it was released. I don't know if this movie was severely butchered on the editing table, or if it was just plain badly directed. It rushes through the story at break-neck speed, jumping from scene to scene without any obvious connection between them (perhaps a narrator could have solved this), resulting in a confused jumble of dialogue and action. After seeing this film, I was SO glad that I had read the book, otherwise I probably would have been wondering what the heck was going on for most of it. This movie is what you get when you try to squeeze the contents of an entire novel into a single film, and then continue to cut it down to fit the attention-span of an eight year old. Recommended only if you're under the age of 10, or are extremely familiar with the book.\n",
            "Rating: , Review: Great movie. Loved the effects, and every thing. Closely follows the book. This is one of my favorite movies, and can't wait until my daughter is old enough to see it herself. Gave me a real passion for the Harry Potter series. The actors where exactly what I visioned Harry, Hermione, and Ron to be like. Dumbdore, Mcgongal, and Hagrid are favorites of mine as well. The movie creates a new world. One that I would love to be in. The animals were interesting as well. Would love to have a dog like Fluffy, and Fang. Even Norbert was funny, and kind of cute. If I had a chance to go to Hogwarts I would jump at it. It would be the best time of my life.\n",

            "Rating: 10, Review: One of the greatest movies ever made! Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is the one that kicked off the legendary franchise which birthed so many fantastic movies. There are already a ton of reviews and comments about this one and the others that I will not get into the specifics of the movie, but I think it's the acting, special effects and amazing story that really set this one above so many fantasy films for young adults. I was still a teen when this came out and it got me to read the books which I am forever grateful. For a young girl, Harry Potter taught me a lot about life, love and magic in a way that I never thought possible. It really has me believing in the power of magic which can overcome all obstacles and make good prevail in the end!\n",

Second, In my opinion, it was a plus that the movie was kept faithful to the storyline of the book. And if the reviewers would have read the book before giving their bad reviews, they would have percieved that the book had a deeper meaning through it's storyline and that's in my opinion is true magic and the movie tried it best to show it. Magic is not just wand flicking and spilling here and there incantations...\n",

I cry everytime I see that first shot of Hogwarts. This series will forever be a part of me.\n",
            "Rating: 9, Review: There's an article at Salon that talks about how little time there is left to remember Harry Potter as he exists in your head - before the big screen version takes over your impressions of Hermione, Ron, Harry and the whole Hogwarts gang. And it's true - it's not exactly how I pictured it, and I'm probably left with the impressions that Chris Columbus has given me.\n",

Every character, every prop, every set, is *exactly* as I pictured it while I was reading the book. It literally felt as if the movie had jumped right out of my mind onto the screen.  From the moment Harry got on the Hogwarts Express, I just sat there with a big dumb grin on my face!  The kids are adorable, and all the acting is superb.  A *very* faithful adaptation of the book, and a lot of fun to watch.  And with a great soundtrack (of course) by John Williams, how could you go wrong?!\n",

The acting was superb, it's good to know that there are still so many great British actors around.  2 1/2 hours is a long time for one film without a break.  However, I don't think anyone noticed the time going - I know I didn't - and in the cinema I was in, the couple of hundred children who sat enthralled throughout the movie could probably have happily sat through the whole four hours of the film's original length. \n",

            "Rating: 10, Review: The movie captures whole heartedly the magic and vigor of the novel. It is a movie that will stand the test of time and be deemed a classic. It reminded me of the first time I watched The Wizard of Oz with premature glee and open imagination. For three hours (although it didn't seem that long), I left Earth and was drawn into the world of Harry Potter. Simply amazing!\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: I haven't been so in love with three 11-year-old kids since I was ten-years-old myself (and that was a very long time ago!!)  I don't think I've ever been in love with a gigantic man like Hagrid, nor have I loved a school.  But I loved all of them after reading the four novels and didn't think I could love them more until I saw the movie.  While I heard others say that they were apprehensive about what \"Hollywood would do to the story,\" after seeing the previews and trailers for the movie, I didn't think it would disappoint me.  It didn't.  I was even more in love with Harry, Ron, Hermione, Hagrid, and Hogwarts when I walked out of the theater than when I walked in ... so much so that I missed them and went back to see the movie again two days later ... and again four days after that.  Everyone who had anything to do with bringing to the movie screen J. K. Rowling's first novel is to be congratulated.  And that includes Alan Rickman, who was the astonishingly nasty Professor Snape.  I can't wait to see the second movie when it comes out.\n",

It wasn't perhaps as brilliant as the book had been, but for nearly three hours of something aimed at ten to fifteen year olds I thought it was spectacular. To keep kids entertained for that length of time, where the average movie is *half* that time, is no mean feat.  And to give me a permanent and unshakeable grin through the Quiddich match was a credit to the special effects, which while not absolutely realistic were convincing nonetheless.\n",

I just could NOT get into the film for the first full hour, but once Harry saw the mirror, I was very much into it. But that first hour bothered me all night after I got home. During the film I couldn't help but think about what wasn't there, at home I couldn't stop thinking that I SHOULD have liked it, but something was wrong. I LOVED the last hour and a half, but that first hour....\n",

The three child leads are superb, each uncannily like their printed counterparts (as I imagined them). Alan Rickman is hilariously nasty as Snape, Richard Harris quietly understated as wise old Dumbledore, Robbie Coltrane IS lovable giant Hagrid, everyone is just RIGHT!

            "Rating: 5, Review: I could not find any passion coming out of Daniel Radcliffe. All I could see was his trying to act hard, which made many scenes awkward. Harry is supposedly the one who develops the theory of somebody's trying to steel the sorcerer's stone and trys to stop it. This kind of stunts must requires lots of inspiration, insights or leadership. But I could not see any of these in this kid. He looks like just an ordinary normal everyday kid. Whenever he needed to provide a penetration or a leadership it looked just strange. It just did not match to his characteristics.\n",

I really hadn't been interested in the Harry Potter books, even when I heard that a movie was in production or hearing the children at the day-care I work at talked feverishly about it.  However, one day I did manage to view and add for the movie on T.V.  It interested me quite a bit to say the least, and I was very curious to understand what these books were all about.  Fortunate for me, my mother had been intrigued by the books as well, and we had just gotten her all four for her birthday.  I picked up the first book, and began to read it, expecting it to be BORING!!!!   Let's just say it took me three days to read Three-hundred and nine pages.  I could not put in down, I have finished the first one, and am already through MORE than HALF of the second one. Of course, after reading the first book, I HAD to go and see the movie.  I was so amazed at what I saw, everything I pictured in my mind was exactly like the movie.  I am now anxiously awaiting the second movie as well.  I am so mystfied by this, I am convinced that a spell from Harry himself has been cast on the books or entice people to read them!!  J.K Rowling really is I believe one of the best authors I have ever read!!  Thank you so much for sharing your amazing gift with us!!\n",

            "Rating: , Review: This movie was just as I expected it to be except for two things Harrys eyes where blue and in the book his green eyes are part of the mystery that surrounds Harry, Second they skipped the part with the the potions on the table in the last part wich showed the cleverness of Hermoine and the importance of paying attention in class, much more so then the Devils Snare scene. Other then that its what I expected bt there where a few more flaws they didn't make you feel sorry for Harry while he was with the Dursleys it just made them look strange instead of mean and to normal and they didn't introduce you to the magic of Harry Potter they just threw you in but it was a good movie and its not Chris Columbus's fault (except the eyes) you just can't take a book that great and make it into a movie thats also that great. So instead of the movie becoming a classic and everyone forgetting about the book like THE WIZARDOF OZ peopole should simply think of the movie as a Harry Potter tie-in instead of the other way around\n",

            "Rating: 9, Review: Maybe a controversial opinion but this is the best movie adaptation in the Harry Potter series! We truly see the world of magic and Hogwarts through Harry's eyes, full of wonder, excitement, and yes, darkness and danger. I don't know why the later films thought they had to be all green light and creepy shadows to get the point across- this movie proves you can do the dramatic parts just through stakes, acting, music and the other traditional movie elements. The kids are adorable, the special effects actually hold up, and Dumbledore, well, he's the true Dumbledore. LOVE THIS MOVIE.\n",

            "Rating: 8, Review: This film was fun to watch and look at, but being a fan of the books and hearing from the press that the film followed the book surprising well, I was disappointed.  There were some gaping omissions that I felt took away from the film. Standing alone, the film was very good.  If I hadn't have read the book I don't think I would have been as disappointed as I was.\n",
            "Rating: , Review: Dear all, I have read the book and I thought it was a good read. So I went to see the (extremely advertised) film. What a failure! Trying to stick to the book as much as possible, Columbus managed to give a fragmented story that will make sence, only because most of the audience have read the book already and will be able to fill the (many) gaps of the story. Trying to keep up with the book so much, the director failed to give \"the magic\" of the book, and strangely enough did some unbelievable mistakes: one of the most important aspects of the book is that only Harry and Dumbledore can call Voldemort by his name. What did the director do about that? Scene No 1: Hagrid explains to Harry that some wizards go bad, and on that scene he has trouble saying the name, but not in the next, when he tells Harry the story and mentions Voldemort by his name!!! The same is true for Hermione later. As for the acting part, I believe it was overdone by most of the cast. My opinion: three out of ten.\n",
            "Rating: , Review: This is what movies are best at . . . pure escapism.  A movie that transports you to places you can only imagine, with a story that isn't written \"down\"to children or \"up\" to intellectuals is rare indeed.  Just a fun ride for all.  If you leave a theater with joy and wonder in your heart, what else could you ask for?  Sorcerer's Stone is a fairy tale in it's best form.  Take it for what it is and don't try to read any implications into the story, just relax and enjoy.  Forget the world for a couple of hours, you will emerge refreshed and regain a little of the magic of imagination you lost while growing up in this world of ours.\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: The special effects were so great.  You could almost believe the owls and the troll for example.  This movie was very well done and I am waiting anxiously for the next movie in the series. I am really very happy with the casting of these children.  They all were so professional but at the same time were believable as school kids.\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: Ok I won't pretend to be a great movie critic, cause lets face it is there one? But I will say this, Hollywood hasn't really impressed me much these past few years. I have been to the movies a total of 4 times in the past 4 years. Thats it. Its because nothing has seemed all that interesting, until Harry Potter came out. Now I have read all the books a few times, and thought the movie was just awsome. I went with a friend who had never read the books and she loved it too. Yes it left parts out, but this is the first book to cinema movie that I can say wasn't a letdown. I am anxiously awaiting the 5th book and second movie releases.\n",

            "Rating: 9, Review: Wands at the ready! Daniel Radcliffe takes up the role of mysterious boy wizard Harry Potter from J.K. Rowling's epic seven part fantasy series. Fans of all ages have been going crazy ever since they heard that Rowling's popular series was going to be transfigured, so to speak, into a film to be showed on movie screens around the world. Yet what makes this movie so unique is that it was not derived from a modern video game or television series, that the younger generation seems to enjoy, but from an ancient form of entertainment. A book! Just what is the magic that is held within those pages, that seemed to have hooked readers into its compelling storyline around the world? Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is filled with plenty of excitement. The screenplay is wonderfully interpreted from Rowling's complex storyline that introduces the Harry Potter realm; actors and actresses portray believable, memorable characters, and every scene is filled spectacular special effects. I find it only fair that this movie is truly a piece of magic itself.\n",
            "Rating: 7, Review: I think Harry Potter and the Philosphers stone was a great movie. It might have missed a few things from the book but it was really good to see all the characters that we would see over the past years until the end of Harry Potter. I myself think that the movie needed a bit more things in it. Like Harry thinking all of it was a dream and how he thought that he didn't belong at Hogwarts and they also should have said more about Harry's scar and his eyes, due to the fact that J.K. Rowling has hinted that Harry's eyes might help him defeat Voldemort. But all in all it was a great movie and I say a job well done to Mr. Chris Columbus for giving us an excellent start to the Harry Potter movies.\n",
            "Rating: , Review: I can't think of any other movie with such great potential.  Too bad it did not live up to it.  Too much was changed.  Too much was cut.  If you read the book, don't bother with the movie.  If you did not read the book you won't be able to follow the movie.  So go read the book.\n",
            "Rating: , Review: Before I saw this movie I didn't know any thing about Harry except for all the hoopla on TV. If you have, like many others, then the movie takes on a new meaning as the characters come to life on screen. For me however it was a mediocre story. There was nothing special about Harry, other than the fact that his parent were killed trying to save him. The burning question I tried to answer as I viewed the movie was why Harry? Why him? Why was everyone so enchanted about this boy (in the movie and in the real world)? I don't think the movie answered any of these questions. It was a good story, with good actors and visual effects. It reminded me of my boarding school days with dormitorys, prefects, houses and the eating in a big room with hundreds of other students. The movie didn't enchant me, but I'm not surprised it did many of Potter's fans.\n",
            "Rating: 8, Review: Imagine yourself struggling through life everyday under the tyrannical rule of a family that sees you little more than a burden. Then from no where you learn that you are in fact a Wizard. This is the situation Harry Potter finds himself in and the film does much to give you the feel that you are truly entering the magical world of Witches and Wizards. Now this doesn't say that the film doesn't have it's slight quirks that take away from the realism such as blatant switches to cg objects from inanimate real ones. However the film does an excellent job of showing viewers the resolve of Harry Potter in overcoming the many hostile relationships that seem to gravitate toward Harry, many of which stem from people's jealousy and fear. Despite the hardships Harry finds strength in two newly formed friendships which allow him to persevere through the numerous challenges he encounters. Hermione a book smart, strong willed female ready to use her intelligence and level head to help her friends in any way possible and the street smart but at times absent minded Ron who shows a great deal of courage and self sacrifice when the situation calls for it. Together the trio unravel a mystery that if left unsolved would have put Harry's newly discovered world in great peril.\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: I rewatch the movie again with pleasure. Thanks to Netflix I can watch it without local dubbing which brings me completely new experience. I love the story and I think the movie is directed perfectly. When I saw it the first time, I thougt:'well, there are misssing scences', but now I think it's done as it should be done. Highly recomended for children and adults.\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: Being a fan of the Harry Potter books I had been anticipating this film for a while, and I wasn't dissapointed! The film brings the magic of the books to life! The characterisation is excellent (you-know-who is as scary as I had imagined) and Hogwarts is magnificent. The only criticism I hold is that some elements of the book were missed out. However, this criticism was not enough to stop my enjoyment of a truly wonderful film. Go Gryffinder!\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: Where the beginning of a whole new chapter of my life started as a child. 10/10 Everyone should see (or read) this series. I watched the first movie as a child, and was told the second was too scary for a child, so I read it in order to watch it. 12 years later I'm still a huge fan, and I don't ever think I'll get tired of this series.\n",
            "Rating: 4, Review: The film itself is regretfully limited in that the characters of the film/book are merely cut and pasted from other literature.  The only stellar aspect of the film is the advertising and marketing done to hold a captive audience.\n",
            "Rating: 9, Review: I was *VERY* pleased with the adaptation from the book. I was afraid that `artistic license' would make them stray from the original, but I'd give them a 9.5 out of 10 for keeping it true. The special effects were sometimes a tad fuzzy to me, but I think that's because I was sitting so close to the screen due to the nearly capacity crowd! I *LOVED* the way they did the invisibility cloak and the snitch in particular. 8 out of 10. Casting was also better than I'd heard. I thought that Harry and Hermoine smirked a bit much, but that may be due to direction rather than acting. I thought that much of the casting was brilliant  particularly Alan Rickman as Professor Snape and whoever it was that played Hagrid perfectly! I was also pleasantly surprised to see John Cleese pop up as `Nearly Headless Nick.' Good casting -- a 9 in fact! Sets & costuming get a 10. Wonderful attention to detail overall -- the movie left me feeling the same way I do about the books -- I can't WAIT for the next one to come out!\n",

My mother first brought me a disc to watch the movie but i didnt know anything about harry portter or anything and belive me i still watch this movie. Harry Potter book mania was in full swing and the phenomenon with the wonderful film series was about to explode with joy. Re- watching the films in order now I can look back on this film with a certain point of view. The first three H.P. films feel like stand alone stories and for the most part set up about 70% of the saga. Now that's was \"Sorcerer's Stone is\" a wonderful world building movie that keeps getting built upon with each new film.\n",

Harry Potter, for those who have been living under a rock for ten years, is a highly successful series of novels for children. The protagonist, Harry, is a neglected eleven-year-old schoolboy in England who learns he is not a regular boy at all. In fact Harry Potter is a wizard. As if that wasn't shocking enough to learn on your eleventh birthday, Harry also discovers that he is not alone, there is a large hidden community of wizardry and magic that Harry will come to live in. \n",

Found the Star Wars and Scooby Doo Trailers more interesting in their running time than the much hyped Movie.  Loved Grint, Watson, Coltrane, Hurt, Rickman, Harris and Smith and the special effects. Film seem to go on forever and I dozed off a couple of times.  Radcliffe left me cold as Harry. Hope the second film is more tight less kitchen sink scripted.\n",

Robbie Coltrane was just fine, Alan Rickman and Maggie Smith were ok, It was a huge waste of Richard Harris' Talents tho..

            "Rating: , Review: I enjoyed this film, even if it could`nt fully match the warmth and humor of the book. Steven Kloves did a very fine job, and I am sure he did write much more dialogue to build up the Characters and the relationships, than we have heard within the movie. I am also sure this had to be left out for : a movie is \"a story told in pictures\", and the filmmakers had to make sure all spectacular plots with their  special effects the audience would expect have to be in. My children would have had the patience to sit for another hour, so had I, and I hope the following movies take their time to transport more of the warmth and humour of the books to the screen. Harry, Ron, Hermiony,-the whole crew are fantastic and capable of all emotional expressions Chris Columbus would have to ask for within the story...! Nevertheless, the movie is well done and a great success- and it deserves it.\n",

            "Rating: 10, Review: So maybe I'm a bit biased, being a Potter fanatic and all, but I absolutely loved this movie. They cut out a lot of parts in the books, but it was long as it was. And rarely does a movie stay as close to a book as this did. Aside from a few trivial facts, it was dead on. Some scenes looked fake, but as far as special effects go they were top of the line. Quidditch was an delightful sight to behold. After watching these books in my head for years, it was a truly splendid experience to see it on screen.\n",

Not only does the series capture the the life of the boy who lived \"Harry Potter\" but the amazing friendships he makes along the way. These movies are full of lessons that people should carry with them through life like: loyalty, courage, not judging a book by its cover, etc. Am I obsessed with the movies? Very much so lol.

It could have been decent had they stuck to making it only an hour long, but alas they didn't. If they had stuck to an hour it would've kept me in my seat, but being tree hours long it was too boring for me to sit in my seat happily. I have no doubt that the book is good, but the movie surely isn't.\n",

I didn't feel like the movie flowed together very well and there was still a lot cut out of the book.  If they were going to cut out so much from the book then they should have made a nice smooth movie that told the same story, without trying to include things in the book that were \"cool\".  There was too much jumping from scene to scene and not enough plot.  If you hadn't read the book, the movie would not make much sense in the end.  I think the books are great for people of all ages, but the movie is simply a kids story.  It just didn't come together the way it should have.\n",

The movie was long and slow in some spots and the effects were VERY fake looking.  (Anybody that complains about Star Wars I's effects looking fake and then extols the virtues of this movie's effects should have their head examined)\n",
            "Rating: 6, Review: Elements of the book that have been edited I would have liked to have seen included but differences from the book were inevitable. The biggest disappointment for me was the quidditch game during which the slytherin team came across as comic-book characters rather than sinister and cynical as they seemed to me in the book. However it remains engrossing despite knowing the story in much detail beforehand. The child actors turn in respectable performances and much of the adult cast is superb, particularly - for me - Alan Rickman as Professor Snape. The sets are superb although there is slightly too much dependence on cg effects in some parts. Perhaps this comment sounds negative but despite the niggles - mainly based on the impossible task of recreating the book precisely - it remains a worthy and entertaining adaptation of the story. 8 out of 10.\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: We went because our kids had read the books and were very excited about the movie. When we got there it was 2 1/2 hours of pure enjoyment. A total release from reality, a young wizard is sent off to wizard school and the adventures he gets into. Classic fun.\n",
            "Rating: , Review: For everyone who has not read the book, read it!! I understand that the movie may have been a little less then par but look at what Columbus had to work with! The book is filled with so many amazing things that he couldn't possible fit them all. This explains any \"choppiness\" People who have read the book know whats going on and can string it through better but I don't think it was so choppy that it was too hard to follow. Forget the fact that its a movie and look around at all the greatness of Diagon Alley and Hogwarts and the train ride! That was my favorite thing, imagining what it might look like and then seeing it! It was like having your dreams become a reality because when you read it everything is so clearly written that you see what Rowlings saw. Chris did wonderfully to see what everyone saw. As for the acting I LOVED Rupert Grint as Ron! If you just watch him he makes the cutest faces. Radcliffe was also brilliant to just watch. Although I love Alan Rickman I thought he could have played Snape a little better. I saw Snape as rather a powerful little weasel but he did ok. Maggie Smith is just wonderful at everything she does! I was disappointed with the shortness of Neville's role however. If you read the book the ending point giving seems more earned for Longbottom. They effects were VERY well done and I wasn't unimpressed with the Quidditch scene although my imagination looked a little bit different. Overall I LOVED this movie and I will continue to love Harry Potter!\n",

Dursley-Sitnikovski, Weasley-Lasichkovski, Malfoy-Loshotkovski, Snape-Zajadlivski, Quirrl-Trepetkovski, McGonagall-Okalkoska and many others).

Rowling is a brilliant, unique woman with awesome talent. The movie did have its disappointments, not having everything from the book, but what movie is EVERYTHING out of a book?  Harry Potter has so much imagination, humor, morals, it just amazes me some people want to ban them. The movie was a definite 10 all the way.  I've seen it 3 times this weekend and seeing it on Wed.

If you are a parent and you want to take a small child, please understand that the length of this movie (about 2hours and 45 minutes) is not very suitable for some younger viewers. The action and climax of the plot was very satisfying, but there are some periods of plot development when the little ones will probably get squirmish. Older Potter fans will have nothing to worry about, as each scene in this movie is worth absorbing with great fervor. Be sure to watch the paintings on the walls in the background, I found many background special effects rather entertaining. Apart from the awesome plot and satisfying (but a bit hurried) quidditch game, the two best parts of the movie were (don't worry, I won't spoil the plot): 1. Oliver Wood, the Gryffindor Captain, played by Sean Biggerstaff. This guy definitely stole the show in his few scenes. He was gorgeous and had an accent, and I only wish they could have put him in more parts of the film. =) 2. Ron's (Ruert Grint) various facial expressions really conveyed his innocence, and he was just fun to watch. In any case, I cannot wait to see this again, and suggest anyone who has seen the book see this movie as soon as possible. Very satisfying!\n",

            "Rating: 6, Review: There has been so many comments about the acting,special effects,Columbus,dependence on the book and so on,that there is no point to talk about those things.But I am honestly interested to know did anybody else think that the music was entirely unsuitable and mostly just irritating?\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: This was a great movie.  It was 2 1/2 hours long but deffinatly worth every bit.   The acting was superb and Daniel Radcliffe portrayed a perfect Harry Potter.  This film  was true to the book.  The Hogwarts castle was cool. It looked so misterious and wizard like(well duh)  They did a wonderful job with customs and every thing else.  For all the Harry Potter fans,  It will be something you should not miss!!!!! I give this Movie a BIG HUGE TEN(10)!!!!!!!!!!!!\n",
            "Rating: 3, Review: This film took ages to get going and when it eventually did, young Harry didn't do much anyway. The little girl is the real star of this film. There were a few enjoyable moments, but overall I can think of better ways to spend 3 hours.\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: As an adult I think I enjoyed this film more than a lot of kids will, although it skips out parts of the book, it keeps to the same plot very well, and you don't need to have read the books to follow the story (although you MUST read the books!)\n",
            "Rating: 9, Review: If you've ever indulged in the fantastical worlds of The Neverending Story or the like, and you just love those hero/journey tales, you'll fall in love with Harry Potter: The Philosopher's Stone.\n",
            "Rating: 7, Review: There's little doubt that the first of the Harry Potter movies is going to be one of the highest grossing films of all time.  It's also widely agreed that Chris Columbus faced a daunting task in attempting to bring Jo Rowling's fantastically detailed world to the big screen.  He does very well, but, in my opinion, he falls a little short.\n",
            "Rating: , Review: I have to admit, I was ready to hate this movie. Having been a long-term fan of the Harry Potter books, a less-than-faithful adaptation could have spoiled it all for me. As it turns out, my fears were unfounded.\n",
            "Rating: , Review: There is no doubt that whatever is said in reviews over the next few weeks about this film, will not effect the inevitable box office success that Harry Potter is destined to deliver. Judging by the amount of anticipation surrounding the movie, it is possible that many editors will be scared to publish critical reviews for fear of being branded as heretics! It is good to know then that on the whole the movie is a thoroughly entertaining affair that follows the true spirit of fantastical adventure. The casting is superb even if the well-known faces such as John Clease and Julie Walters often only appear very briefly.  Robbie Coltrane stands out from the main cast as an inspired choice and manages to bring a certain charm that enchants the audience whilst the slimier than ever Alan Rickman reminds as all why he plays the ultimate bad lad. As for the children's characters, there are a variety of talents on offer with Daniel Radcliffe putting in a fine performance in the lead role and a reassuringly annoying Emma Watson as the oh so highly strung Hermione. \n",

            "Rating: 10, Review: Harry Potter and the Philosopher´s Stone is a great movie. Why? Because it´s the representation of a loyal Hogwarts, like the book. Rupert Grint (Ron Weasley), Robbie Coltrane (Hagrid) and Emma Watson (Hermione Granger) are excellent!! I love the movie, but... I think the books are better than the movie.\n",
            "Rating: , Review: I have read the book and loved it. I wanted to so badly to say the same about the movie, unfortunately this was not the case. I was seriously disappointed. The film does stick very closely to the book and perhaps this is where it is flawed. Good books do not always make good screen plays ! The film was enjoyable but unfortunately too long and in parts boring. There are bits in which need not be there and likewise parts are missed which would have worked (where was Rik Mayall playing Peeves??!). If you are a Harry Potter fan already you will enjoy this, if you haven't read the book you might wonder what all the fuss is about!\n",
            "Rating: , Review: I've never read any of the books, I had no idea of the story (of course I'd heard of Harry Potter), but thought I'd check out the advance screenings of this VERY hyped film.\n",
            "Rating: 7, Review: A very good attempt, fast action all the way, perfect for the younger viewers to keep them enthralled through the longer than average running time, but not really thorough enough to please the people who appreciate the intricate and intimate relationships between the central characters and their backgrounds. The amount of 'family history' missing from Harry and Ron's lives completeley changes their characters; you don't know why Harry is living in a cupboard or what a terrible upbringing he's had, you don't realise how the Weasley family's financial struggle is a constant embarrassment for Ron, so the 2 boys seem a lot happier and carefree than the books portray them.\n",
            "Rating: 8, Review: This is a really excellent film.  I was expecting a long movie, but the time just flew by.  If anything, it was too short.  The cast were absolutely superb - Harry, Ron and Hermione were perfect.  Alan Rickman's Snape stole every scene that he appeared in, and Robbie Coltrane really had Hagrid nailed.  The sets were breathtaking - especially Hogwarts and the special effects were everything you'd expect from a big budget film.\n",

            "Rating: , Review: I will give the movie credit: they stuck extremely close to the book. Unfortunately, that's about as good as it gets. Daniel Radcliff as Harry has unseated Jake Lloyd in Episode 1 as Worst Performance by a Child Actor in a Major Motion Picture. Ron and Hermione aren't much better. I don't know who coached the kids, but they all seemed to take a page from the William Shatner textbook for acting. None of the three can get through a sentence without having a long, surprised, dramatic pause, accompanied by stuttering and repeating themselves. For example:\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: Columbus did a GREAT job with this movie.  The content was very consistent to the book, and he couldn't have chosen better actors for the roles. Harry Potter brings out the imagination in all of us and I don't know of any child who hasn't dreamt of flying.  The movie captured all of this and much more. The special effects were wonderful, and kept my children spell-bound, (no pun intended) the entire movie.  May the Magic keep coming and the 5th Book come along soon....A Sincere Harry Potter Fan,  Angela\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: We went for a work outing yesterday, and got in on the first showing in Horsham, PA. I had read all the books, and enjoy sci fi / fantasy. I'm also an avid RPG computer fan, and play a high level wizard in Everquest.\n",
            "Rating: , Review: I'm sorry for anyone who like the movie but it was totally different from the book. Yeah,  most of the dialuoge is the same but it skips important parts in the book (ex..the SECOND Quidditch match, yes there is suppose to be two quidditch matches for those who haven't read the book, and the last chamber before he goes and gets the stone, it was suppose to be Professor Snape's challenge.) If it wasn't for the main characters that were still in it, you might have thought you weren't in the right movie. They also left a character out that is mentioned once in every other chapter. Peeves the Poltergeist. How could they forget PEEVES!!! well, this is my opinion. If you haven't read the book, you might enjoy it, but if you have, you might possibly not.\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: I was ready to be disappointed because I thought the imagery in the book was so great that I doubted it could be reproduced on the screen.   But I was wrong!   I THOROUGHLY enjoyed the movie and was just so impressed with what I saw.   The Quidditch competition was wonderful!   The moving staircases... the wizard chess game ... just fabulous!\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: Although I did not read any of the books, I understand this movie follows the first book very closely, just not as much detail.  A great story with excellent acting and special effects.  Small children (under 8) may not be able to follow the plot because of the number of characters involved. However, it is a must see for everyone.  It is a very long movie (2 hours 33 minutes), but it never drags.  Get to the theater early to get a good seat.\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: I cannot believe how quickly the film was over.  It was amazing - not only the film but how much of the book was covered and covered very well.  I cannot wait to see what Columbus can do with the other books.  I do hope to see more quidditch.  \n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: I just went to see the movie because of all the hype. I had never even read the book. That movie was just awesome. It really was immensely enjoyable. I'll definitely go out and buy the books now. I suggest to anyone who hasn't seen it to go out and do so today.\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: After reading all of J.K Rowling's excellent Harry Potter books, I was a little unsure about what to expect from the film. It is so very hard to convey the essence and vitality of a book to the big screen. Little did I know that I was in for a massive and rather pleasent surprise.\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: I thought Harry Potter was an awesome movie. I loved all the neat computer graphics, and I'm glad they didn't overdo the computer graphics. The story mainly stuck to books, there were just a few added sentences. There were no added scenes, and I knew before I saw the movie that they wouldn't be able to get all of the scenes in. It would be impossible to do so unless if the movie was like five hours long. Anyways. I loved the movie and how closely it followed the book. Ü\n",
            "Rating: 9, Review: Great job by most all the cast.  Standouts for me were Snapes and Hagrid.  The kids were believable in their roles.   The overall impression of the film was a lush panoramic depiction of the book. Hogwarts came to life!  I look forward to the Secret Chamber.\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: I could NOT believe HOW good this movie was!  It was so very true to the book (thank YOU Mr. Columbus and Ms. Rowling!) and the casting was SUPERB! My soon-to-be 9-year-old daughter, who has read all 4 books, did not \"see\" Maggie Smith as Prof. McGononagall.  I did not \"see\" Emma Watson as Hermione.  She is a FABULOUS actress, and she is very pretty.  I pictured Hermione, as did my daughter, to be more \"nerdy\" and I have heard others thought Emma was an awfully pretty Hermione.  She still did a great job!\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: This movie is positively yummy! All fans of the Harry Potter series should check out the first installment of movies.  I saw it in a theater full of children (most under the age of 10) and it managed to keep their attention through the entire 2 1/2 hours, that is most impressive.  The cast and crew could not have done a better job on the movie it was ALMOST perfect!   I am definately going to see it again.\n",

A must see movie!!!!\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: I've read all 4 of the books, and this movie was definitely true to the first book.  There were omissions, obviously because of time, but none of the information had been altered.  Even the descriptions that the author took great efforts in detailing in the book, came to life marvelously in the movie.  It's a great story with a great cast!\n",

            "Rating: 10, Review: While no book adaptation is never as good as the original book, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's/Philosopher's Stone is the best book-to-screen conversion that I've ever seen.  I've seen many movies, a lot of them adaptations, and Harry Potter is done remarkably well with great characters and special effects that don't detract from the story.  If you liked the book, or you just like a good movie, check this one out.\n",

            "Rating: , Review: As an avid fan of the Harry series, I found it harder to sleep November 16th than any December 24 I can remember.  The theatrical experience did not disappoint.  Scores of fans clapped and cheered throughout the movie.  And the reason is obvious.  Chris Columbus painstakingly detailed the essential elements of the book and brought a world that existed in the imagination to life.  While many have panned the movie as looking like a book on tape (see mean comments from New York Times), this is the highest complement that could be paid to the movie:  It is just like the books.  Well, maybe not just like it.  Of course certain scenes had to be excluded.  But the greatest brilliance of Columbus was in the selection of the scenes and artful editing for time.  The result is that every scene captures the essence of the characters and plot.  Of course every nuance and scene could not be included in such an introspective and intricate plot, but this valiant attempt is true to both die hard fans and those who will become fans when they enter the world of H. Potter!\n",

            "Rating: , Review: every harry potter fan will be super excited when they see this one!  yes, it sticks to the book, it's wonderfully done, the acting is spectacular (remember you're dealing with child actors here - it's not *perfect*, but it's so close who could care?).  however, there are some things that you may miss if you were looking for an exact book-to-movie experience (which never really happens anyway).  harry meets draco at hogwarts, not on diagon alley. the sorting hat doesn't sing (something which actually upset me - i was really looking forward to that!).  norbert is not rescued from the top of the tower (he isn't in the movie much, but he's there enough to get a great laugh!).  regardless, it's a wonderful movie.  i almost cried when harry got the photo album of his family from hagrid.  also, they did a great job with snape - plenty of hints as to who is really after harry that i probably wouldn't have picked up on if i didn't know the book.  hey, it had to be good - a whole theater full of kids, and they all kept quiet for the full 2 and a half hours!  everyone should see this movie, harry potter fan or no. it's wonderful and well worth the nine bucks!  i can't wait for the next one - why a whole year?!?\n",
            "Rating: 4, Review: What could have been the fantasy film of the decade has turned out to be another Hollywood fastbuck disappointment.  With so many truly talented fantasy directors out there - Tim Burton, Terry Jones, Terry Gilliam, heck, even Steven Spielberg - how is it Chris Columbus wound up at the helm? With two and a half hours to play, how did we end up with a movie with absolutely no character development?  There is no soul, no wit, just a dry Cliff's Notes version of the book.  Columbus and Kloves may have read the book, but they sure didn't get it.\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: I couldn't believe how well the adaptation was made from book to cinema. Simply put this was an outstanding movie. It kept you enthralled and mesmerized with the story and action. \n",
            "Rating: , Review: I have to say I am disappointed in the reviews it makes me wonder if those that have seen it saw the same movie my husband(who is 32) and myself (24) have already seen twice I could not have imagined a better cast when I first read the first book right off the bat I knew who should (if they made a movie) play Snape Alan Rickman did a great job as did the child stars who play Harry,Hermione, and Ron I can not wait for the second one to come out, and can not wait for the new book Chris Columbus did a wonderful job, and except for a few parts the FX are great and the parts that are cut out are not that big of a deal that they mess up the story line, as for someone saying as long as your are between the ages of 3 and 13 you will enjoy it that is hogwash this is a movie for the entire family and I know I will be going to see it again while it is in theaters and will buy it when it comes out on DVD.\n",
            "Rating: , Review: Having not read the books, nor have I really followed the \"Harry Potter\" universe (other then what I have heard others talk about it), I went to see the movie for entertainment.  From that viewpoint the movie was okay (yes I was entertained).  The best way to describe the  movie/story is that it is a child's fantasy.  From what I do understand of the \"Harry Potter\" universe, the movie fits well, and I would say that if you are a fan of Harry Potter, you will be happy with the movie.\n",
            "Rating: , Review: I think that I was more excited about this movie coming out than my kids. I was in such a state that I went to a 9:15 am showing.  I am sad to say that it was not as spectacular has I had hoped.  I felt that it should have been much more colorful, with more special effects. I understand that they had to pick and choose scenes for the movie, but there were some crucial things that should have been added.  I did not like that Hogwarts was so forboding, or that the train was not made more eye catching.  My son and I actually dozed off at some parts.  The movie was okay for people who had not read the books, but I think that many readers will not be has happy with it. It really left me feeling as though the story was only half told.  I wanted to see more magic, more character relationships.  I know that we have no desire to see it again.\n",
            "Rating: 5, Review: My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed all of the Harry Potter books.  We were both disappointed by the movie.  One of the primary reasons for our disappointment has been all the hype about how closely the movie follows the book. While the movie follows the book better than some, there are numerous places where the book plot was cast aside by some editor with no appreciation for what makes the books so magical in the first place. Important plot points were either cut out, or revised for the best visual effect.\n",
            "Rating: , Review: It was an ok movie.  I was disappointed that the emphasis was so heavily on special effects.  I thought that more character development of Snape and McGonagall, and the students and their relationship to each other would have benefited the film a great deal.  Many of the special effects (the killer plant, the boat ride, Gringotts banks, the turning stairways) could have been sacrificed to provide screen time for enjoying the relationships between the students and for establishing the rules and environment of Hogwartz (Ron beats Hermione at chess, Fred and George are a couple of bludgers themselves, Percy is Prefect and proud of it, Ron and Hermione tit for tat, some classes are with Slitherins and some are with other houses and some are just Gryffindor, the names of their different classes, Snape protected Harry because Harry's Dad saved Snape's life) to the overall improvement of the film.\n",

            "Rating: 10, Review: This movie was well put together. Even though they took out some of the scenes that are in the book and shorten the encounters with people it was still good. All the actors/actress who got picked to play the characters in the book played the part excellent.\n",
            "Rating: , Review: Let's go to the movie checklist: Does Harry Potter have a great cast of actors? Yes. Harry Potter has probably the best cast I have seen in a long time: Alan Rickman (Severus Snape), Robbie Coltrane (Hagrid), Maggie Smith (Prof. McGonagall), Richard Harris (Albus Dumbledore), and John Cleese (Nearly headless Nick). Then there's the three main characters who, for how little acting experience two of them had, did a pretty good job. Emma Watson fit the role of Harmione, and my vision of what Hermione acted, and looked like very well, and Rupert Grint fit the part of Ron Weasley perfectly, and neither Rupert, or Emma have had any experience acting in movies. Daniel Radcliffe on the other hand, was merely 'ok'. He wasn't great, and came across to me as being very dull, and boring, and more 'mugglelike' than most muggles. To top it off, Daniel's voice cracked halfway through the movie, and they were forced to voice over the rest of it, that is why it seemed dubbed at the last part of the movie.\n",

            "Rating: 10, Review: Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone(a.k.a. Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone) casting directors did a glorious job casting for this film. The people they put in the various roles were actually how I had envisioned them from the books. Only Harry's eyes were green, not blue.Some characters, take Oliver Wood( portrayed by Sean Biggerstaff)or Seamus Finnigan( Devon Murray), to me, didn't really have a role in the book. They were simply there. In the movie Seamus Finnigan( Devon Murray) provided comic relief while Oliver Wood (Biggerstaff) was there to inspire Harry about Quidditch. All in all the casting was very well done and I hope to see many of the same cast members in any later movies.\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: This movie is one of the best ones I've seen in a long time. It was really well made and the acting was good. Although they did skip a scene from the book that I really wanted to see, it was just like the book. I can't imagine why anyone wouldn't want to see this movie or read the books.\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: I would say that this movie contains the exciting imagination of what J.K. Rowling has written in her novel, \"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone.\" Although there are parts on the book which are not strictly followed, it doesn't matter because the movie is more or less presented in a way that audience will not be bored on it...If you have red the book, you would feel the same emotions and excitement in the movie...my favorite part would be the Quidditch game between Gryffindor and Slytherin...it was like watching a cardiac NBA game that will surely thrill everyone...when the game sequence ended, I stood up and clapped my hands into excitement as the Gryffindor house wins the game.........\n",

            "Rating: 10, Review: Okay, it was not quite as good as the book was. Did anyone expect it to be? In books, we use our imaginations. Movies, the imaginations are given time off. For that alone, people forget that the movies that are based on books are only certain peoples imaginations instead of our own. But I digress...\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: Two and a half hours of pure pleasure.  Not only did it offer an escape from the unpleasantness of reality, it gave me a chance to relive my childhood when I wanted to fly away from home and see what the universe had in store for me.  Great entertainment. Can't wait for the sequels.\n",
            "Rating: , Review: I have to admit, the books were much better. But the movie followed them almost perfectly and the things that weren't supposed to be in the movie turned out just as good. They did cut some scenes, but they had to, or we'd be watching a 4 hour movie! I thought the cast was excellent. Also, and I have to put this in cuz I'm a teenager, they got a major hottie to play Oliver Wood! Well, If you liked the books you will almost definately love the movie so I recommend that you go and see it!\n",
            "Rating: , Review: The film does the best it can in, compressing an 8-hour book into a two and a half hour film. Especially when you consider the book contains some 21or more rich characters; non-stop action, intrigue and interwoven incidents; beautifully described locations and scenes. Well.. you just can't you can't do it! But this film gives a good taste of what the book is about a general whip through the plot.\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: I think this was the BEST movie that I have ever seen, the special effects were totally real, there was the acting, Professor Snape did one of the best parts!!I love this movie, and so did my mom, my aunt, my 13 year old sister, her friend, and my Grandma!!\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: I think that Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is more than a great movie, because it is fantastic joy of fantasy, it's like dreaming the book. So if you didn't read the book, the film will be kind off empty, because you can't dream something you never experienced. Just read the book first, and than enjoy a great movie, I'm looking forward to the next three books, and six movies!!!\n",
            "Rating: 9, Review: Not since Harper Lee's \"To Kill a Mockingbird\" was adapted for the screen have I seen such a loving rendition of a book into a movie--\"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\" has (book author) Rowling's motherly fingerprints all over it, thank goodness, and has mercifully avoided the Hollywood \"hipper than thou\" standard.  Chris Columbus is to be congratulated for making a movie with real heart.  Although some concessions necessarily had to be made in the script, the spirit as well as the letter of the book is wonderfully captured.\n",
            "Rating: , Review: I took my two sons (7 & 8) to see the movie and they absolutely enjoyed it. I thought the movie was good, but was disappointed with how it quickly rushed through the introduction.  In order for those who haven't read the books to understand how important Harry Potter's character is, I thought the movie should have focused on some of the smaller points in the book, i.e. the celebration of the wizarding world after Lord Voldemort was believed to have been defeated and of course the memorable first time he boards the Hogwarts express and you sense the excitement of the Weasley family when they discover that they have just met Harry Potter, the excitement aboard the train when word gets out that Harry Potter is on the train and how astonished Harry is with all this attention.  But enough about what wasn't portrayed, overall I think that the movie was done satisfactory.  Not many can successfully translate a book motivated on pure emotions into a movie. It may be able to satisfy you visually, but not connect you with the characters the way your own imagination can.  The actors were wonderful and played their characters true to form, but again I wished that they had more time to better portray their characters, especially Snape.  I only hope that those who haven't read the books but have seen the movie will be motivated to read the books so they too can understand what all the hype is about. These books have given new life to reading instead of watching T.V. or playing electronic mindless games.  I'll definitely go to see the next Harry Potter movie, but I doubt that I'll rush out to see it as soon as it's released.  I will however stand in line to buy the next book!!!\n",

            "Rating: 8, Review: While we all obviously know that the movie is not an exact visual copy of the book, it does stand well alone. Think of it as all the pictures for a fully illustrated copy of Rowling's work thrown together in a whirlwind of color and magic and fanatsy and one can't help but be happy and enthralled when leaving the theatre.  And all the nit-picking asside, the most important thing Columbus absolutely had to do right was the casting, which was so perfect, I doubt it could have been better (I'm excited that we have the fabulous Kenneth Branaugh to look forward to in the Chamber of Secrects as Gilderoy Lockheart!).\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: It's really a spectacular movie; they got the music PERFECTLY as well as the actors, it's not many who could make a film like this and have it be such an international success.  I congratulate them for that, as well as the superb actors they selected.\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: Harry Porter is one of those seasonal beers that changes from year to year. Great Lakes Brewery made a brilliant version last year, called Harry Porter and the Bourbon Soaked Vanilla Bean. It was glorious, and popped up periodically on cask. It was like a party in my mouth. In fact, it was some of their best work.\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: I've seen this movie twice, and it was just as great the second time.  I rarely see movies in the theater, much less repeats.  It had wonderful casting, around the book, not around any particular star.  It was the filming of a book, not the making of a movie, and stayed relatively faithful to the original, especially compared to most adaptations of popular books. A definite must-see for adults and children alike.  The first time I saw it was with my parents and 18-year-old brother, the second with my 27-year-old fiance.  We all enjoyed it as much, and perhaps more than, the children in the theater.\n",

            "Rating: 10, Review: Usually when I go to see a movie like this, I have extremely high hopes since the trailer is so promising. And then you actually see the movie... and get even more surprised! This is just one of those movies you wanna see again, and again, and again, and... I think you get the picture. I have only seen it once, but this movie just made me even more wanting towards the next movie and just calls out for me to see it again. I might be 21 by now, but belive me, age and magic are 2 things never forgotten! The actors, the scenes, the special effects and let´s not forget the score by none other then John Williams (Star Wars, Indiana Jones), making this movie a journey into a place you do not wanna leave once you are there. Experience the movie, and be a wizard yourself...\n",
            "Rating: , Review: In the opening scene of 'Philosopher's Stone,' Professor McGonagall (Maggie Smith) muses that the entire world will one day know the name of Harry Potter. The disturbing thing is, she isn't far from the truth. The 'Harry Potter' books, created by single British mum, J.K. Rowling, are now the most popular and best-selling books in history, their worldwide sales surpassing those of  J.R.R. Tolkien's fantasy epic, 'The Lord of the Rings,' which for the last few decades has enjoyed the exalted position of being the highest-selling novel in history. So if you haven't heard the name of Harry Potter by now, you must have spent the last few years buried away in an underground cave on Pluto, with forks in your eyes and your ears stuffed with lead. These days, it's almost impossible to enter a shop without seeing his bespectacled face staring back at you from either a packet of jellybeans, a magazine, a pair of boxer shorts, a kitchen knife, or a tin of lawn mower fuel. Which is why it's no surprise that this is undoubtedly the most hyped film in cinematic history. But the big question on everyone's lips is: does the film live up to that hype? And the answer - yes and no.\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: To say the least I love these books. Some might say I'm obsessed , but I'm not, I've only read all of them at least 4 times. But this is all beside the point. When I went to see Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, I had prepared myself for disappointment, because every movie that is based on a book is never as good as the books. But I was surprised . The movie was very accurate, they just cut out some of my favorite parts. Like Norbert the Dragon, he has a whole chapter designated to him in the book but in the movie he has like 4 min. But then again they couldn't have this be a 4 hour movie. But the main thing that I was upset about them cutting out, was one of my favorite lines. But don't get me wrong the movie was so accurate you could practically read along, well not quite but you get my point. This is probably because J.K. Rowling overlooked the making of the movie. My father who was the only on in my family who has not read the books, loved the movie, and this has caused him to start reading \"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets\". Which I imagine is happening everywhere. Which is great because the books are wonderful and have morals, like even if everyone hates you there is someone out there that will love you. And plus reading is fundamental. Which would help our world in the bad shape it is in.\n",
            "Rating: 5, Review: Overlong, lacking in humour, short on plot, poorly acted by the youngsters. Overall, the film generally lacks any magic.Another 3 of these to come? O No. However, I'm told by those who have read all the books that the stories do get more gripping as the tale progresses. Let's hope so.\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: I had my expectations as I sat down in the movie theatre on the 2 December 2001 to watch Harry Potter, afterall there was all the hype and the reviews were amazing but nonetheless being the critique extraordinaire that I usually am I decided to remain totally open minded and make up my own opinions.  What can I say, I was temporarily transported into a world of sheer bliss that I so wanted to remain in and hope it never ended.  I call it my escape into the magical world of Harry Potter, what funtastic stuff this was.  Now I am feverishly looking for all 4 books to purchase and keep for my kids some day so that they too can be part of this wonderfully exciting realm of fantasy.  Am I over-reacting...no its not often that we as adults of the 20 century can truly loose ourselves in a magic wonderland ever so often. Everything little minute detail right down to charming Mr. Radcliffe was perfect so all thats left to say without giving away too much is that you haven't really been a child or an adult for that matter if you miss out out this one!!!!\n",
            "Rating: 9, Review: I think that this is an excellent movie, although some elements of the book that should have remained, were removed.  I think that the acting was scratchy at some points (by the kids), but with future movies it will improve.  This movie is one for all ages, races and backgrounds, as it teaches the importance of friendship, loyalty, and teamwork.\n",
            "Rating: , Review: That movie was great, Hermione was just like as I expected that she would be! The others were nice too, but Dumbledore looked a bit like Santa Claus. I loved the movie, but the book was better. But, you can never make a good movie from a good book. So, I think, the movie was good, and best of those what I've seen.\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: The casting of this movie was genius.  Everyone was just as I pictured while reading the book.  The scenery, the effects, everything was right on the money.   Even the Quidditch match was just as I had imagined.  I am eagerly awaiting the release of \"The Chamber of Secrets\".\n",
            "Rating: , Review: Since he composed the music for Star Wars and Indiana Jones he's one of the Great Unavoidables; and he won't let us forget. The charm of Harry Potter is the whimsical combination of high-quality storyline/visuals with what is essentially a juvenile setting, in the \"Boarding School Meets Tolkien\" vein. Alas, the film becomes brash, pretentious, and in-your-face by the blaring fanfares and thundering bass strings which are hurled at the audience at all moments and from all corners. From quidditch match to corridor encounters with Snape, there's Williams's MOOZICK telling us that this is BIG and EXCITING. Baboom, vavavavrunch, kablang, tinkletinkle. I found it really annoying and, melodically, very shallow. This type of score is basically an acoustic form of special effects, a horror vacui, and it's all piled on way too thick. Producers, please give us a break in the follow-ups. Less is more; and less Williams would make a much better movie.\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: omg this movie was sooooo cool, snape was hilarious, i was cracking up every time i saw him!!!! i seriously think that this is the greatest movie i've ever seen in my life!!! it is definately worth the $5.75 to get in to see it. everyone in the movie is soooooo good.(although, when i was reading the book, i pictured mcgonagall to be younger than she is in the movie-but...IT'S ALL GOOD) omg go see this movie if you haven't yet, it's sooooo good\n",
            "Rating: 8, Review: The film is well done, good CGI effects and a couple of moments that you just don't expect (even if you have read the book)that could make you jump out of your seat (it happened to both at least half of the friends I went with - total of 36). The movie suffers of a few hard cuts while changing scene (time and place) especially in the first half an hour, very episodic. From the moment Hagrid appears it really kicks off and gets better and better with very memorable moments as such as the quidditch game and the chess match at the end, rivaling Goonies' best moments. Overall a very well done movie that suffers from the book structure very far from what a movie goer is used to.\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: The start to the Harry Potter film series is filled with visual splendor, valiant heroes, spectacular special effects, and irresistible characters. It's only fair to say that it's truly magical. The settings manage to be sensationally imaginative and yet at the same time so clearly believable and lived-in that you'll think you could find them yourself, if you could just get to Platform 9 ¾.\n",

I was shocked however, when I saw it, I thought it would be EXACTLY like the book, but I found it wasn't, in fact, I found many things in the movie that did not correspond with the book, but I will not name them, so I don't spoil the movie for you, like most critics on tv and newspaper do. Bottom line: if you get a chance to see it, WATCH IT!!  Its well worth the money.\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: This film has a very complex task. It must introduce us to a whole world, characters, species, magic, and conflicts to set the stage for the series, but at the same time it must have a story of its own. Although many moments seem rocky and sometimes just basic, it nevertheless draws you into the world. It leaves behind every aspect of the world familiar to viewers and transports you to another place. He does his best to create this world, and with outstanding costumes and sets and an incredible score by John Williams, this film is truly magical.\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: Great movie! Chris Columbus just incredibly portrayed the first book in the film, the actors are perfectly matched, and the world just sparkles with magic. I think Harry Potter is a nugget in movies in principle. You can always watch it with your family, you can review it numerous times one by one. This film is a kind of psychotherapy for any person. The kindest movie in my memory!\n",

            "twists and wonderful achievements of the director. The film was shot for a large audience, and these are visible. He can 't not neither adults nor children will like it. After watching it, any child will believe in magic, and not only a child, even an adult will want to receive a letter from Hogwarts. The plot is shrouded in a lot of secrets and magic, it can't help but fascinate. The places where the film is shot are a separate story. After all, to pick up such magical places that the film interested the viewer not only in the plot, but also in the place quite difficult. But the director of the film did it. The film is suitable for viewing with family, with friends. If you want to cheer up, then watch the Movie Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, you won't regret it.\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: \"The Philosopher's Stone\" is a fairy tale. A real fairy tale. Bright, kind, not very complicated yet, but already responsible. And the main three there are so ... fabulous and somehow unearthly. Everything is magical there. And you smile like a real kid, just because the very presence of Harry before your eyes inspires such hope, such infinite joy that you rejoice like a little child. Because he's already a part of you. Because everyone can deny it, but you know that they, too, almost roared when, for the hundredth time, reviewing the film, they suddenly realized how selflessly Ron acted, sacrificing this very horse, so that there was not even a global danger. Because they suddenly realized that this is where friendship begins. It is by such actions that one must earn true trust. And nothing in the world can replace such a friendship. And, like hell, you didn't even dream about it.\n",
            "Rating: 4, Review: I was disappointed in the story and the acting.  There were too many weaknesses in the story as it was presented.  The extremely ill treatment of Harry by his aunt, her husband, and their son, for nothing more than her dislike of her sister because she was a wizard, seemed overly severe and not well founded, at least as presented.  Another small point of many, I'm not a fan of politically correctness, but, taking the Stone from the bank without informing them is theft no matter whether its the good guys or the bad guys and is a poor example in children's movie.  Then to hide it behind a three headed animal which will kill anything, adult or child, seemed a little heavy.  Unfortunately I was disappointed by much more, not the least of which was the much of the acting.  Most of the characters looked their part, but I have seen much better acting presentation, particularly, in the lead roles, in far lower rated movies.  While I found the story line old and cliched, it is amiable but presented too fast for what was necessary to fulfill the story or characters presentations. Sorry!  Only a 3. AJH\n",

            "Rating: 6, Review: Having never read any of J.K. Rowling's work, I was quite curious to see if the reasons for her recent publishing phenomenon would be apparent from the film adaptation. Unfortunately the answer is a resounding 'no'.\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: My son and I were looking very forward to seeing the movie as we have read all 4 books.  I've never seen a movie after reading the book. I now understand what people mean when they say it's not as good as the book. Can it be though?  If it were we would be sitting in a movie house for a good 6 or more hours.  I feel they did a great job with the time they had.  It was exciting \"meeting\" the characters and getting a lesson on the correct pronunciation of the names.  My favorite character was Ron, I loved his facial expression and his quick wit.  So perfectly cast!  My son's favorite character was Harry (of course!), he's just perfect for the role.\n",
            "Rating: , Review: I loved Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone, it was so much like the book it was unbelieveable. It is rare to see movies that are so like the book. The only thing that I would have changed was the sorting hat. I would have loved to hear it singing of the different houses. There are seven books so hopefully when the other movies are made we can hear it sing at least once especially since it sings a different song every year. The characters were wonderful, I think the did a fantastic job picking out the cast. I look forward to seeing Harry and his friends in Moaning Myrtle's bathroom when they take the potion. It will kind of neat seeing Hermione turn into a cat (2nd book), I can't wait to see Harry flying on Buckbeak (3rd book), and I am curious to see the reaction on uncle Vernon's face when he sees everyone going back to the Burrow using floo powder. I am sure that will be a sight (4th book).\n",

            "Rating: 9, Review: This movie met all of my expectations.  I did think that I had an advantage because I had read the book.  It brought the movie together.  I think that the actors did an excellent job portraying their characters.  I really enjoyed how everything came alive and was very true to my mind's eye.  From Harry to Snape the characters were like I had imagined them.  Good job Chris Columbus!\n",

            "Rating: 8, Review: Yes,just like many other ones' comments:it's great,the film has actually done its best to reveal the funny and amusing plots you can find out  from the book,but I was objectively feeling that if one has not read the book,he may not understand what the film was going on at all.It really has a blurred start,not indicating clearly which is which and made me feel quite disappointed at some places.For example,as we already know that harry was living in Dursleys' bully,and that we definitely won't confuse Harry and Dudly,for Harry's so skinny and Dudly's big size.But the editor maybe thought that when Hagrid said to Dudly,ah,you must be Harry,it might can make watchers laugh.But I really think it an unwise action.And it also missing the story that Harry and Hermione took the dragon nobert to the top of the tower,which i think is attractive and important for the story's going on.But neverthless I would say that the movie is worth watching among so many boring and dull films!!\n",
            "Rating: 9, Review: When you watch this movie you can feel like a child. The movie reflects the book well and it's really good. I can sense that fairy-tale wizardish climate. The characters are wearing wizard clothes and I like it that way.\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: First off, I just have to say that since I have discovered Harry Potter, I have been excited by his adventure and the imagination involved (although I have found other commentors haven't). I get a rush of excitement when I know that what I'm about to read is new and full of amazing characters, places and ideas. That's what \"Harry Potter\" is - a land full of magical brilliance where you can let your mind wander - it's incredible. Now you wonder how a movie can live up to that? Well I have to say that it is exactly what I expected - which is a lot. It lives up to its counterpart and  passes with flying colours. Everything is how I imagined it to be down to the very last piece of chicken on the plates at the feasts. This movie is a trip to your imagination and could not be better!\n",

THIS IS NOT THE BOOK, IT'S THE FILM! Since when, have all film adaptions from books, been faithful to every page? they haven't! look at \"The Wizard of OZ\" one of the most famous fantasies ever...that film is incredibly differant from the book, but just keeps the guidelines...just goes to show you... and many film adaptions have left bits out, and added parts for the better!\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: This Film was one of the best I have seen since 1975. I thought that the characters gelled together very well. Best of all they were an all British cast. Having Read \"Harry Potter's Philosopher's Stone\" before the film. I felt that they stuck to the book and you couldn't fit the whole story in 110 minutes. Despite this the musical added to the magic and the young actors played their part really well. My favorite character was Ron Weasley as he added a comical dimension to the film.\n",

I have read the books, and found that the movie was very true to the movie. I believe that Chris Columbus did an excellent job in this movie, which seemed to make the whole world of Hogwarts come alive. Also, we must stop and thank Daniel Radcliffe(Harry), Rupert Grint(Ron Weasley), Emma Watson(Hermione Granger), Richard Harris(Albus Dumbledore), Maggie Smith(Professor McGonagall),Robbie Coltrane(Hagrid)  and the rest of the cast of this wonderful movie. I have never seen a movie so true to it's book.\n",

When they announced the production of these books to film people were sceptical of Warner Bro Studios ability to keep the magic and boy did they keep the magic. The actors playing the roles are so talented for such as young age and Emma Watson is another story. Outstanding for someone who had never been on screen before. I was really impressed. Although some scenes were slightly fake the overall movie was amazing. I really enjoyed it. I do however recommend you read there books before the films.\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: The \"movie\" I feel was awesome!! They did a fantastic job! I had to see it 3 times. The first time, it was great but, I wanted more parts of the book in it. After I got over that initial shock. I went back and saw it again, carefully watching everything so not to miss anything. It was just exhilarating especially the \"Quidditch\" game! Even though the movie was 2 1/2 hours \"short\" it seemed to go by too quickly! I could have watched it for another 2 1/2 hours and it still would have been too short, but more aspiring. As my daughter says \"it is so cool.\" The 3rd time (as they say) \"was the charm.\" It is a very fun and charming movie and we can't wait for the next movie to be released of the 2nd book \"Harry Potter and The Chamber of Secrets,\" and don't forget to read the 5th book of the series as well as the ones before, they contain so much more interesting information that if you liked the movie and haven't read the books, you will love them too!!!!!\n",

            "Rating: 10, Review: Not since the release of Star Wars in the 1970s have I truly experienced a film, and not just viewed it, until I was whisked away by the magic and wonder of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. I've read the four books of the series more than once, and wondered how a film would be able to capture the fantasy and imagination of such a writer as J.K. Rowling. The movie was brilliant, with its special effects,which were incredible, somehow appearing so real! The adventures of Harry, so wonderfully portrayed by young Dan Radcliffe, have taken me back to the wonder and excitement of my own childhood imaginings. I find myself thankful that my own children, who love the books and the movie, are experiencing the kind of movie-magic that made me so happy as a child, when at that time, it was George Lucas who took us to a galaxy far, far away to \"lose\" ourselves, in awe, at the magic he created...It seems as though, finally, the magic has returned with the story of this young boy who is suddenly brought this unex pected revelation of his unusual heritage, and by the sheer fact of who he is, he becomes thrust into that powerful struggle of good and evil, when sometimes it can be difficult to discern what is the good, what is the evil...We're cheering you on, Ms. Rowling, and everyone who has a part in \"bringing to life\" the heroic Harry Potter! Keep the magic coming, and thank you!!\n",
            "Rating: 8, Review: I thought the movie was great, but it could've used a little more humor that J.K. Rowling wrote in the book.  So as not to make the film to heavy.  My favorite scene was with the Mirror of Erised.  It was so touching, I wanted to jump into the movie and just hold Harry and be there for him.  One of the advantages about the Mirror is it let him see what his parents looked like and could put that into his memory.  All in all a very good movie.\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: Harry Potter has captured my imagination and taken it places I've not thought possible.  The movie was pleasant to look at, with gorgeous scenery and eye-popping special effects.  I was shocked to see that 'Harry' hadn't cracked the top 50 fantasy movies.  Judging by the numbers, I'm in the minority, but if I compare this series to the Lord of the Rings, there is no contest in my opinion.   Harry takes the day.   The Lord of the Rings would be a three-hour nap for me.  Perhaps I dislike it because I had to read 'Rings' in school, although I had to read `The Adventures of Tom Sawyer' and became a huge life-long Mark Twain fan.\n",

It starred Emma Watson, Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, Tom Felton and others amazing actors. Little Harry found out that he was a wizard. He went to Hogwarts School of Magic. At Hogwarts, Harry found friends, enemies and many adventures. This is the first film from the Harry Potter film saga. This film is filled with wonder, magic and a fabulous atmosphere. The film has cool special effects and interesting character. I really admire this movie. It leaves no one indifferent. I think this movie should be watched by everyone who loves magic and exciting stories.\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: The movie was great and the actors were brilliant. Maggie Smith is a perfect Professor McGonagall like Richard Harris and Alan Rickman are for Professor Dumbledore and Snape.Robbie Coltrane was espetacular. When I read the books I picture Hagrid just like in the movie and the child actors were just right I could not have wish for a better Harry, Ron, and Hermione.\n",
            "Rating: 7, Review: Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is great entertainment. It reminded me of the innocent swash-buckling high adventure of the Indiana Jones movies, and it's easy to see why rumours about Steven Spielberg directing the third instalment of the Harry Potter franchise have begun to surface. All in all lots of fun and I'm looking forward to the rest of the series.\n",

            "Rating: 10, Review: Only one word appeared in my mind after I've watched the movie and also read the book:excellent!!!!!Rowling succeeded in bringing us to her magic world to 'learn' her magic and adventure with Harry,Ron and Hermione!While Chris had been loyal to the book and created the magic  world wonderfully with his talent and brilliant ideas!The chemical reaction they initiated made me believe that there are really wizards and witches,and I just can't stop myself dreaming to be one of them!!!I'm looking forward to the arrival of 'The Chamber of Secrets' and I totally believe that it will be as wonderful as its predecessor!\n",
            "Rating: 7, Review: I went to see the film before reading any of the books and left a little disappointed. I was hoping for a story of wonder about a fascinating world of magic - I got an entertaining story about three children with wands. It was good but not great. Subsequently I decided to buy the books - the first three of which I got on tape read by Stephen Fry. I cannot over state how great his reading of the unabridged books are, it was everything I hope for and more!\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: Sure, they could not possibly include all the scenes and action from the book; but it is a movie, not a mini-series and not everything would fit. Nor did they add any new interpretations or expand characters. That was not necessary and it would be unfair to the author and all the loyal fans. And there are a few minor inaccuracies that obsessive fans might notice, but they do not really harm the plot. If you want the WHOLE story, with all of J.K. Rowling's wit and delightful dialogue, read the book. I encourage you to read the book and/or buy the audio tape, which Jim Dale brings to life with some very funny voices. All that aside, the movie is well made, the action scenes are inspiring, and the cast is superb; especially the kids, who look and act like kids (amazing). I am looking forward the next (and the next and the next).\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: Whilst appreciating the restraints of turning a book into a film,I felt the film missed a lot of the atmosphere and emotion of the book ; the 'characters' were too 'pretty' and 'clean';in a way it missed the 'Magic', in it's widest sense, of the book.....it was a film for kids........not a film for everyone.\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: i love Dan! in this movie, he is everything that harry is supposed to be, young, brave, talented, and most of all pure of heart, how can u resist? and even after fighting \"He-Who-Should-Not-Be-Named he remains true of heart. good luck in the forth coming movies Dan, Rupert, and Emma. i hope to see you stay as perfect actors as you are today. i hope to see you in more movies/plays. I truly believe that all of the actors do an amazing job considering that in this first movie they are only around eleven years of age. i wish them well. i personally cannot wait to see Harry Potter and the Order of the Phenoix. Every year i go to the midnight premier (this being no different), and I am ready for everything the griffandor three have in store!\n",

            "Rating: 6, Review: First of eight films and set the tone. With a cast of young actors, and at the time minimal experience the film only lacked 'acting techniques'. Now, this is not to say Emma, Rupert and Daniel couldn't act. They could, it's more how they went around doing it. So, although this was a downer for me, the choices Warner Bros made was fantastic and they really suit there roles.\n",
            "Rating: 9, Review: My opinion The first time I watched this movie, I was very excited about it because it was a fantasy movie and created it interesting and realistic in the characters. It's all all of them and when watching continuously, it's very fun. If the movie comes out at each time, I think I am one of them that will definitely follow the story of this story and is a movie that can be seen. All ages and is a movie that anyone who sees it for the first time must be excited and follow the movie from the search for information to a movie made from a personal novel. I didn't read a novel before watching the movie. But saw people who read the movie say that the content in the novel is more diverse and more detailed in the movie and in the movie has changed a lot of chapters But if watching a movie and going to read a novel, it might change the perspective of watching movies in another way.\n",
            "Rating: 9, Review: \"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\" is a film that will transport viewers to a world of wonder and enchantment. From the moment the opening credits begin to roll, audiences are swept away by the stunning visuals, soaring score, and captivating performances.\n",
            "Rating: 2, Review: According to First Alliance standards\n",
            "Rating: 5, Review: On par with not a few made-for-TV Disney movies I've sat through with my under-10 year old kids. After reading the first, long-winded volume of this series I was not compelled to continue on at all. The movie was really close to the book...closer than a lot of film adaptations are. I guess that explains why I probably won't see the next few movies: nothing in the first one makes me like the characters or care what happens to them next year...not even one iota of curiosity.\n",
            "Rating: , Review: I thought this movie  had a great plot and Christopher Columbus really scored with this one. I think that the acting was excellent for such a young cast. Robbie Coltrane did excellent, and Maggie Smith and Richard Harris were brilliant. I can't wait til the next one.\n",
            "Rating: 8, Review: Every so often a tale comes along, that not only rips the audience from reality but bewitches the imagination and keeps us crawling back for more. A phenomenon that could be no other than the \"Harry Potter\" series filled to the brim with entrancing worlds and amiable characters. Rarely among the majority of most films does the story unfold so beautifully onto the big screen. Rowling is a master of making believe-able characters in a make-believe environment and so is the movie's director; Chris Columbus as far the casting goes. Daniel Radcliffe, as the great Harry Potter, Rupert Grint as Harry's loyal friend, Ron Weasley, and Emma Watson, Hermione Granger. Each plays an uncanny duplicate of the books persona making the film almost parallel from imagination to film. Rowling's story of mystics and magic takes the viewer and shakes them out of the mundane comatose of everyday life. As she, leads the audience to an escape (lasting shyly over two hours) to a fantastic visual world that delights those of all ages. I highly recommend this movie to any \"Harry Potter\" fan. Even if you aren't a fan one watch and you will be two.\n",
            "Rating: , Review: I love the Harry Potter series and have read each book at least 15 times. I could tell you absolutely anything about each book. I love the movie I thought it was a wonderful adaptation for the time allowed to it.\n",
            "Rating: 9, Review: I enjoyed the movie, it captured most of the book very well. There were even a few additions that were put into the movie. My only regret was there was not the second Quidditch match played for the cameras.\n",
            "Rating: 6, Review: I was underwhelmed.  While the actors were all excellent, I expected better special effects.  I also don't think it was the best adaptation of the book. It jumped around too much, left many things poorly explained, and just seemed to lack coherence in general.  We got the feeling we were watching a movie made 15 years ago.  I don't know if it's because of the screenplay or the fact that the movie was probably nearly worn out.\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: If you want a fun fun movie with a great story and great cast this is it!! The people making the movie are right on par with the book, and the casting people did great at picking the players.      Dont be fooled into thinking this is some kind of subversive anti god! thing or demonic evil type of witchcraft movie, it's the fantasy type (aka the wizard of oz type or sabrina the teen witch would be more of a sample) Go get this on dvd or video it,s a movie to watch over and over again!\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: This movie was so excellent and thrilling, I wish it were real. Chris Columbus did a great job with directing this movie and made it go very well with the book. There were only about 50 mistakes, which is NOT a lot. This movie was great and I truly hope everyone sees it. God Bless The USA!!!\n",
            "Rating: , Review: I have seen this movie it is AWESOME. I bought it the second day it came out. I have the game on playstation. Some people think its bad because they do magic but those people need to get a freakin' grip ;) I would recommend (I think that's how you spell it) this movie,books,or game to anyone. As you can probably tell I like Harry Potter and I know a lot about it. You ask me something about Harry Potter and I'll probably know it 8)\n",
            "Rating: 8, Review: I found director Chris Columbus's Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone to be a wonderful and thrilling interpretation of J.K. Rowlings novel. With the understanding that this famous film was just one way to visualize the events of the book, it seemed to reach the general fan's imagination. It kept me on the edge of my seat wondering what the next magical move or spellbound adventure would come along. Not everything appeared as it did in my imagination but that's okay because Mr. Columbus was just using his. I do have a small complaint however I thought Daniel Radcliffe's portrayal of Harry Potter was a bit lacking. His character's dialogue was not very impactful; he appeared to be the shy boy that every high school has. On the contrary, I came to the conclusion that Emma Watson's character; Hermione was a bit more likable than Rowling's. She appeared more as a slightly troubled girl as opposed to a mean brat. In the end, Rupert Grint's performance as Ron Weasley was the most memorable. With his quick thinking and cunning one-liners, he seemed to overshadow the mind of Potter. Even if this movie wasn't what you pictured while reading the novel, it was a remarkable view of a fan that is just as enthusiastic. This movie has something that everyone can enjoy, humor, life lessons, intriguing characters, and edge of the seat plot line. I actually saw the film before I read the novel and I discovered that to be a fun twist compared to reading the novel first. But which ever you do, you will be sure to have a fun filled adventure with the delightful cast.\n",

            "Rating: 10, Review: I just wanted to put in my two cents and say that this movie is spectacular and that I can't wait for the next one. I've read all four books and I'm dying for the next one of those as well. Anyone who enjoys fantasy should definitely see this movie. I hope J.K. Rowlings continues to write about Harry and his friends.\n",
            "Rating: , Review: Many parents were worried that this movie would delve too deeply into the Black Arts.  Watching it with an open mind, I found it avoided the pitfalls that would make it too \"Dark\" for children too watch.  The children actors were absolutely excellent.  As good, or better than any young actors in ANY movie.   Kylopod@aol.com stated they had never been to a movie that the people applauded at the end.  I had the pleasure of seeing the Indiana Premiere of Star Wars.  They audience through their arms up and cheered at the  FX of the first jump to light speed, and when Han Solo helped Luke at the battle of the Death Star.   Goose bumps, big time.\n",
            "Rating: 9, Review: I really loved the movie, but it's not quite as good as the book.  There is one thing I wish they'd have done though...they said they cut hours and hours off of the movie so they could put it in theatres.  So why couldn't they offer the DVD with the full uncut version?  I know I would buy it. heck, it's a DVD I could watch some of it and pick the rest up when ever. Anyway, I loved it. :)\n",
            "Rating: 8, Review: This movie is a great piece of work. Even though some parts of the movie were changed. I was still very nicely produced.\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: Over the top!!! They couldn't have picked out better actresses and actors!!! It was a beautiful performance of acting.I really liked the way Harry was brave, but yet caring. I imagined Hermione just as she was in the move. And Ron was as good as ever!!! It was great show of theatrical ability!!!\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: This magical film starts with a young Harry Potter who is known as popular, but living with his aunt and uncle with his cousin, he really doesn't get treated that well, honestly the worst family you've ever seen to go into. But, on his 11th birthday, he discovers that he's a wizard after not knowing.  We follow as with his engraved on his head, he goes to his first year up Hogwart's School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.  He meets Ronald Weasley and Hermoine Granger and they head to find and stop an evil wizard from getting the sorcerer's stone as all three embeleck to fight and to help Harry to find hie true destiny through many battles and twists along the way.\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: I really liked this movie.  I thought that it was great.  It was something that I took my 3 year old to see and he sat and watched it.  That is very unusual for him. I would recommend that if you haven't read the book that you do because the book will fill in the spots where they cut stuff out.\n",
            "Rating: 9, Review: I thought this movie was wonderful. I first saw it without reading the books and I thought it was excellent. It inspired me to read the books, and I am now currently in the middle of reading them. After reading the first book I watched the movie again, and I did see the differences and what they left out, but you can't expect everything to fit into a two and a half hour movie. But all in all it stays pretty faithful to the book, which I think is great. This movie definitely will inspire you to read the books, if you haven't already.\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: Draco Malfoy wasn't in it that much(which sucked). He makes the movie. I think Malfoy should be in it more. (HE IS SO HOT!). I also think that Slytherin should have won the Quidditch matches and won the end year thing(who ever got the most points thing).\n",
            "Rating: 4, Review: I put off seeing this movie for a long time because i was real fan of the books and i thought the movie might ruin the story....i was right.\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: I think that Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (Sorcerer's Stone in America)was over all very good. I think it could have been better, not to mention that they changed too many things. They left out many of the important scenes that built up to the final ending. I would definitely choose the books over the movie. I think Chris Columbus could have done a WAY better job. Take a look at his other pictures; Home Alone. He did a great job on them, but it seems that he slacked off for Harry Potter. I think that even I would have done a better job directing the movie, and 1. I've never handled directing equipment, 2. I haven't even finished high school, 3. I wouldn't make the movie so boring and drawling. Also, another thing he kept doing was putting his daughter in the movie. She played Susan Bones, but SUSAN BONES DIDN'T HAVE ANY LINES OR ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE STORY EXCEPT THE FACT THAT SHE WAS SORTED INTO HUFFLEPUFF! His daughter had more screen time than Tom Felton did, and Tom Felton was one of the major cast! I gave the movie a 10, because over all it's a pretty good family movie and it was ok. I did however, find it rather boring. The only parts that really kept me from falling asleep were scenes with Malfoy cause there was actually some action in it. ~Kandi\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: From the first time I saw this movie I felt in love with it ( and with Alan Rickman(actor)).If I hadn't seen the movie I would never ever read the HP book series.I highly recommend it.I saw it about 13 times myself and they are not enough.I learnt the words off by heart and keep talking about Harry Potter.My parents and my friends got sick and tired of me speaking about HP and Snape.\n",
            "Rating: 8, Review: POSSIBLE SPOILERS\n",
            "Rating: 9, Review: I don't see why everyone is giving \"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone\" a hard time. Sure, it doesn't cover all the events from the book, but it wouldn't be possible to do that anyway given: a)the film is only 2-and-a-half hours long and b)some of the events of the book simply could not be translated onto film.\n",
            "Rating: 8, Review: This Film is Brilliant, I didn't go the the cinema to see this film instead I rented it out, now I regret that and would Love to experience this film in the Cinema atmosphere. I saw the film before I read the book, I bought all the books right after watching the first installment of Harry's adventures and Read them all within a week. I fell in Love with Hogwarts and If It was a real place I would Love to live there. When The chamber of Secrets is released I am going to the cinema to see it and not waiting til rental. The story starts with Harry as a Baby being left on the doorstep of his Aunt and Uncle's house, It then jumps to 10 yrs later and Harry is living in a cupboard under the stairs.  He is treated like a servent and waits on his Aunt Petunia, Uncle Veron and there spoilt son Dudley. Harry has no idea who he really is, even though he sometimes does things he can not explain, it never crosses his mind that he is different from his relatives. Then he starts recieving mail from a Hogwarts School Of Witchcraft and Wizardry, he never gets to open the letter because his Uncle Veron keeps taking them off him. Owls arrive every day delivering the Letters and It gets so bad that They decide to go away where no one can find them, Or so they thought!!. On Harry's 11 Birthday a Giant of a Man named Hagrid arrives at he location they thought was safe and explains to Harry that he is a WIZARD!! and that his parents didn't die in a car crash ( which is the story his Aunt and Uncle told him ).  He then goes to London with Hagrid and goes to the Magicail shopping area for Witches and Wizards, Diagon Alley, There he buys his school supplies which include a Wand, Cauldron and a Owl. He then has to catch the Hogwarts express on Platform Nine and three-quarters, While trying to find his way to the Platform he meets Ron Weasley another First year at Hogwarts and they strike a friendship straight away. They meet Hermione Granger another first year a intelligent girl who repairs Harry's glasses on the train when she is looking for Nevielle Longbottom's pet toad Trevor. I won't say any more for I don't want to give away the whole story, If You want to know any More just rent the Film. A must see film!!\n",

            "Rating: 9, Review: \"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\" became a hit in the year of 1998. The movie was released in 2001. Compared to the book, the movie was OK. The movie may have left out a lot of important parts but it still flowed nicely and it still kept your attention. The acting in the movie was really good. In my opinion, the actors seemed to match the criteria of what I accepted them to be. The movie starts off as a scene of Harry Potter being dropped of on a step because his parents had just been killed. How they died is later revealed in the movie. Harry is forced to live with his mean Aunt and Uncle. He is treated as the outsider of the family. One day Harry gets whisked off to Hogwarts by Hagrid Hogwarts is a magical school for wizard. Harry, not knowing he was magical, was very happy. The movie then takes the audience on a journey with Harry, revealing the dark secrets of his past and other people's around him. He finds him self in tricky situations where is has to use his head and his heart .Good vs. Evil. The plot itself was a good plot and the book and movie easily flowed well. The Special effects were fine they looked real and they looked OK. They were suitable. The script writers should have used more of the book then they did. Even though the movie was good some scenes could have used more dialog from the book and it could've made the scene more worth value but overall the movie was good.\n",
            "Rating: 7, Review: In Harry Potter, the main character Harry, is orphaned when his mother and father were supposedly killed in a car accident so he is forced o go live with his aunt and uncle, The Dursleys. Since his aunt and uncle are muggles, normal people, they don't tell him that he is a wizard, because they just want him to be a \"normal\" person. He is soon rescued from his aunt and uncle by Hagrid who is a wizard back at Hogwarts. Harry then learns about his past and is introduced into the world of witches and warlocks.\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone was an excellent film, in a series of Harry Potter films. Although not as good as Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets it was very high up in its ratings. The acting in this movie was wonderful. It had great special effects and dialog.I personally felt it was amazing that the whole movie was done by kids who have just started acting, but was still an amazing movie. Emma Watson was perfect in her acting as Hermione.Good Job.\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: This movie is one of the very interesting and great movie I have ever seen. This story is in a magic school, but we can sympathize their school life, for example classes, friends and love. I think this fact is one of the reason why Harry Potter is liked by all over the world.\n",

            "Rating: 10, Review: When I walked into the theater with my ticket for Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, I wasn't expecting it to be as enthralling as the novel had been but from the very moment it began, it held me in its sphere and kept me in suspense. It was like being introduced to Harry all over again! I can't wait until Nov. 15 so that we may be reunited once again.\n",
            "Rating: 8, Review: I think that the film was beautiful: I liked the castle because it was very big and mysterious and the Quiddich matches were very captivating; I liked also Ron because he was very funny. I saw all Harry Potter's films because magic is interesting for me. However I have read \"Harry Potter and the order of the Phoneix\" and \"Harry Potter and the half blood Prince\" and I think that books are better than films because they are are more complete,in fact books contain more details and information about the characters, their physical portrait and personality and about the settings, landscapes and interior of the castle. My favorite characters are the Weasley twin brothers, because they play tricks and they are funny. The end of the film was beautiful in fact Harry defeated Voldemort and the Socerer stone was destroyed so the inventor of the stone had to accept to die. However I wish the Sorcerer stone existed like in this book because if it existed I could live forever too.\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: I think that this is one of the best books that are made into movies that I have ever seen, they didnt miss a thing in the story line. Some things are cut but if they hadn't it would have been 4 hours long I think they did a wonderful job. I would tell anyone to read this book and see this movie.\n",

The moves will only get better from here, I just saw the new trailer and think the next movie will be a bigger hit then the last one. i also hope J.K.rowling will be coming out with her new book soon.\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: I enjoyed this movie. The movie is brave and fantasy story. I love Harry Potter very much. But I like Ron and Hermione too. Harry is brave, Ron is funny, Hermione is intelligent. This movie is wonderful and brilliant!! It is pure movie magic. But I prefer the book. This movie is something good for children and adult to watch. I watched movie all Harry Potter series. But I think so first series was interesting!! I rate this a good 9 out of 10. I especially liked the last scene where Harry fights against his enemy. The visuals of the scene was spectacular. I will always remember this scene. Watch on large screen.\n",
            "Rating: 9, Review: This movie was awesome, but to be deeply moved, one had to notice subtleties.  I watched the movie after reading the book, and I found it very easy to see how badly Harry longed for his parents, and how he drew from that love to ultimately defeat Voldemort.  My parents, who watched the movie with me had never read the book, however, and I don't even think they figured out that Harry's parents were dead until the middle of the movie.\n",

There is a great deal of funny dialogues and breathtaking scenes. The only problem is that the movie is divided into pieces those don't connect to each other. This is all!!\n",
            "Rating: , Review: This movie is the only movie that i watched more than five times. At the beginning, i was trying to focus on the details of the movie and the book to compare the different between those. But later on, the more i watched it, the more i felt i like it because of all of the effects they put on the film. Even some parts of the movie was not the same as the book and the details were cut off to make the film shorter, the film still make people understand the situations and the details of the book. One of the most important thing i like about the movie is that the character of the movie were very successful in acting and let people feel more interesting about the film.\n",

            "Rating: 8, Review: Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone(the Philospher's Stone outside of the US) began what would become a highly successful series consisting of eight films. The story centers around a young boy named Harry Potter, who after being raised by his abusive uncle and aunt after his parents were murdered years earlier, finds himself swept on a journey that will take him to Hogwarts, a school that trains wizards and witches. Along the journey he makes new friends and enemies while learning magic and overcoming the evil that spelt the end for his parents.\n",
            "Rating: , Review: So, another movie rushed on by. Sadly, even though it has a good concept and it adopts an original, good theme, rarely met on movies these days (because most of the movies these days promote violence one way or another), even though all this, this movie isn't so good understood by us, the watchers. If you don't understand a movie, how can you appreciate it? Thanks to the fact that I have read this book after which the movie was made, I understood the movie and this lead me to appreciate the movie by his high standards (good actors, original theme etc.). I'm glad however that the movie was very faithful to the book, because it is a good book indeed. Even though we all know that Harry Potter is actually the hero of a series of novels (children's books) the movie isn't so easy to be understand (it is not only a children's movie). That is why I highly recommend everyone to read the book before they see the movie (J.K. Rowling obviously knows her way with books and adventure, she's great!). Only understood, the movie can be truly enjoyed. It's a real pity if the movie isn't well understood. About the movie, what can I say? A little foggy, not too clear, that matters too, doesn't it? But for me, what matters most is not the picture itself (although this is very important, because that is what movies are all about), is the message that it is trying to promote and how it manages to do it. For start, I think that Daniel Radcliffe was very well picked because he looks just like the Harry Potter I imagined while reading the book. Rupert did too. And that was a pleasant surprise. The actors gave an impressive \"act\". I liked Richard Harris (Dumbledore), Maggie Smith (professor McGonagall), Robbie Coltrane (Hagrid). Alan Rickman (professor Severus Snape), Tom Felton (Draco Malfoy) and of course, not to mention Daniel Radcliffe (Harry), Rupert Grint (Ron) and Emma Watson (Hermione), the undoubtedly known trio of the movie... The movie's story is very attractive. Harry, an ordinary, orphan boy was living a miserable life with his uncles. One day (more precisely, on his 11th birthday, which no one bothered to remind) he discovers that he isn't so ordinary after all. He finds out he is actually a well-known wizard who had very powerful wizards as his parents. When he find out the truth about his past, Harry is invited to join Hogwarts, a wizard school. There he makes friends a funny boy, Ron and a smart Muggle-born girl, Hermione. And with Ron and Hermione by his side, Harry faces great dangers send by the evil Lord Voldemort who killed his parents and is now after to kill him, in search of a powerful stone that bring immortality. Interesting story, isn't it? We can however easily see that all the \"action\" spins around Harry who is the main character. My favorite parts of the movie were the Quidditch match, the giant chess board game, the Zoo were Harry went with the Dursleys and the discussions between Harry and Dumbledore. All these scenes were made and designed thru Chris Columbus's \"wand\". He did remarkably well as a director. I appreciate the fact that he respected the book, not interfering with his personal stamp and ideas which would have certainly spoil the movie. It was a tense and a relaxing movie altogether, not to mention, funny! I found myself laughing all the way. This movie let us -the ordinary Muggles- to see our Muggle world as it is thru wizard's eyes. That gave me something to think about. The movie and the book turned me in a real Harry Potter fan. Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is a good movie basically because, with its popularity among people's movie preferences, shows us that everyone -age doesn't matter- absolutely everyone wants a little adventure in his life, a little adventure and. magic!\n",
            "Rating: , Review: I Love Harry Potter, because this is wonderful, special, beautiful, mysterious, and enchanted movie. When I was elementary school student, my mother's friend gave me this book. Then I was moved and I became love it. I thought it good that Harry is ordinary person, but at middle time, he was knew I'm wizard. He became friend with Ron and Hermione, and they became best friends each other. When this was showed as a movie, I was so glad. Director have done good job, because he showed real Harry Potter's world. My favorite is moving picture. Many picture is moving at the world; newspapers, portrait, book's cover etc. Also I was moved by final scene which Griffin dole won among another team, because they threw own hat at so big hall. We are moved, because we know that they had many troubles and they passed them. So this movie is so good, I think. Let's watch this.\n",

I have not read the books and don't intend to. As a movie, Harry Potter is magical and enjoyable! Period. Faults and all. Only certain movies from my own childhood remained in my memory as fantastic as I only wished they were true! Willy Wonka, the Wizard of Oz, Close Encounters to name a few. I know my kids will regard Harry Potter in the same way.\n",

            "Rating: 9, Review: I love the Harry Potter movies. They are great in every way. In the first book we find out all about this world where people use magic for all sorts of things. They even go to a school and learn magic. Then a movie was made and it was great. But there were things that happened in the book that would go good in the movie. But overall it is a great film. I give it a 9/10.\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: I really enjoy both of Christopher Columbus' films in the Harry Potter series (he also directed \"The Chamber of Secrets\"). The first two films of the Harry Potter series are definitely the two that manage to catch every aspect of the magic that was involved in the Harry Potter series. This is an amazing start to a great series of films.\n",

            "Rating: 10, Review: The Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (Hey, I'm from England)movie was brilliant. I watched that before I read the books and I loved it. So many people make cruel comments about the fact that it didn't live up to the book but that really isn't the point is it? It was there to be enjoyed and on the whole, it was. You can't expect a movie of this magnitude to be made without some things being cut out. If the whole book was made into a movie, with every detail intact, it would last for a good 3 hours and while I can sit that long, many children can't. In my eyes, the books and the movies are separate things with the same names and I love them equally.\n",
            "Rating: , Review: I really like the Harry Potter series, and it was interesting to physically see all the characters that I've pictured in my mind. The effects were pretty good and the little jokes throughout the movie were great. I was disappointed about how they had some characters act. Hagrid wasnt as angry as he was in the book, people werent that afraid of Voldemort's name, Wood wasnt as obsessed with quidditch, Fred and George weren't as clever and sarcastic,and Dumbledore wasn't as energetic and strange as I thought he would be. They left out some key things from the book that might be important in later \"years\". However,I still quite enjoyed the movie and I'm very excited to see how the next few will be.\n",

There are many cases where understand each other and a certain moment was able to understand each other to be the friend who is not at first also in the grown-up world.Another pleasure has the good place which can enjoy signs that they overcome distress together with a friend and grow little by little, through series.Their friendship was materialized when Harry and Ron who go to help her who was shut up by one person into the toilet took action.A sight of Harry who pushes on despite fear, and Ron was caught, and when it was itself, I thought thoroughly what it would carry out.\n",

From the powerful cast to a great direction to a great and fantastic special effects, this movie not only boast in storyline but there are some pretty good damn delivery of their lines.\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: This film was good but not that good. The reason i say this is because of the acting, what I mean is the acting is not very good. Also the score could have been better. Other then the acting and the score the film was pretty good.\n",

            "Rating: 6, Review: Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone is probably my favourite film from the franchise, though this is largely for nostalgic reasons, it definitely has strengths. Richard Harris' Dumbledore is calm and wise, as he should be, we trust and revere him implicitly, Snape (Rickman) has the appropriate level of menacing sweep, his opening scene is arguably the highlight of the entire series as he informs us, quivering in our over-sized robes in our first week, that we can learn how to put a stopped in death, and Emma Watson is delightfully bossy as Hermione. She is, of the main three, the one who shines throughout all, with arguably the hardest part, she brings emotion, intelligence and a hefty helping of guts to a well-loved character. The film is not big and brash, unlike some its successors, it is simple and relies on the quality of the story being told and the actors doing that. It makes little or no go at impressing the audience, and in doing so, embodies a childlike inquisitiveness and charms its audience into caring about mirrors and stones and 'silly incantations.' That is its pivotal achievement; that it can take the viewer back to a moment before they knew what a tax return was, or that Voldermort would rise again. Right from the moment Richard Griffiths practically sneers 'No post on Sundays,' you know the film will make an admirable attempt at recreating the magic of the books, but try as it might, it eventually falls short of the standard required to do justice to a novel, which whilst it may not be expertly crafted, had enough about it to capture the hearts of a generation. At eleven Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone was one of the most awe inspiring things I'd seen, but several years on, it leaves something to be desired.\n",
            "Rating: 9, Review: This is an amazing movie! I think they stick to the plot of the book (more or less) and the cast is great. Emma Watson, Daniel Radcliffe, and Rupert Grint are all very young but you can see the talent. Maggie Smith is amazing as always as is Alan Rickman (Snape). I do like the Dumbledore actor in this movie more then the others in the series. Coltrane is awesome as Hagrid and the movie is uplifting and keeps you riveted to the screen for two and a half hours. If you haven't read the book, you will love the characters and entertainment this movie provides, and if you have read the book, you will be delighted to see it so accurately mimicked in the movie. All in all, this movie is definitely worth the watch and I recommend it to anyone.\n",
            "Rating: 9, Review: Hello I have saw this film and I loved it!!!!\n",
            "Rating: 4, Review: As someone who has not read the books and just watched the movie for the first time I am surprised with what I encountered. Harry Potter comes across as having a hero complex or some nonsense. Why does he feel like he and his posse have to be the ones to figure out what is happening. If he just let the professors do their job things would work out, that Snape guy seemed like a pretty sharp individual I am sure he had things covered. Letting my kids watch that I was just thinking to myself, \"If all this rule breaking went on in my house I'd have to lay the law down\". Harry and company though, they get to take a walk in the woods as punishment. Just missing the hut made of candy if you ask me. The other thing I noticed was dividing the student body into groups or social division going on. First you see \"muggles\" having their own classification and then the first thing they do to first years entering the school is sort them into cliques. It's like they are asking to create a rift between students and on top of that there is a house cup competition going on? No rules whatsoever if I feel like docking points I do. I mean that leaves the gate open to favoritism if you ask me. So in short the movie focuses on an entitled boy who thinks it's ok to break rules because he is the chosen hero in a school that supports dividing the student body.\n",

            "Rating: 8, Review: I liked the place which this movie is taken because it is very beautiful and mysterious especially the Hogwart school and the place where Harry Potter go to the Hogwart by train which made me feel it is not real. I liked the sound effects and the special effects of the movie which made me feel very strange and comfortable. I especially like the climax which Harry Potter, Ron Wesley and Hermione Granger fight with the three-headed dogs. I like the chess which they can ride on it. Although the chess is unreal. the sound effect is very specific. Also, the animation is very wonderful and beautiful. It is a good film and a good entertainment. I can learn English through this. It can also improve my listening skill. I will watch it again and introduce this to my friends.\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: Harry Potter Is simply astonishingly perfect. It's clear to see that everyone Involved, from Author to Producer, from Actor to Fan, all have nothing but love for the Harry Potter franchise. Just like myself, many people grew up with Harry Potter, and If you didn't grow to love the franchise more and more by each film, then there's definitely something wrong. \n",
            "Rating: , Review: Even though the others adaptations of Harry Potter's novels weren't all successfully brought to the screen, this first movie is undoubtedly a great success and probably the best of the whole cinematographic Harry Potter's saga. The scenarist Steve Kloves succeeded in remaining faithful to JK Rowling's book, whereas the director Chris Columbus managed to make us enter in this magical world with delighted child's eyes, and sort of realism. From the beginning, we are moved by this young boy starved of affection who suddenly discovers he is a wizard. We are out of breath too when Hogwart School of Witchcraft and Wizardry appears for the first time in front of us, and we shiver of course when Harry Potter finally faces the dark wizard. The magical universe JK Rowling created, his creatures and his lovable characters just can't leave you without any feelings : Harry Potter's friends are your friends, and his enemies are yours as well ! This film is an excellent movie to watch with the whole family, however the next movies become darker and darker and are gradually aimed at an older audience. Harry Potter is definitely a story to grow with !\n",

Dim down the lights have a comfortable sofa, have a big screen , nice smooth climate or turn up the a/c , have a hot pizza, and enjoy the biggest Family magical adventure of lifetime.\n",
            "Rating: 8, Review: This movie, by itself, is a good movie. But if you have ever read the books then it is just terrible. There is so much left out that Rowling gives to the reader that Columbus takes away. Anyone that has not read the book could tell you that the stuff left out is just details and fluff but a for a reader knows those are what make the Harry Potters so great. The movie is just a spectacular action/fantasy movie, but the book is a story about students at a school with real plots and problems. Yes the effects are good, and the magic is exciting but the feeling that the characters are real is lost. The little fights with Draco Malfoy, the teasing Harry about the danger of Quidditch and other little occurrences that make you believe they are real people and not just movie characters.\n",
            "Rating: , Review: If you like adventure and fantasy films, you have to watch 'Harry Potter' based on the Harry Potter books by J.K Rowling. The series of films beginning with Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (2001) and culminating with Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2 (2011). This is about a wizard boy, Harry Potter, and him magic adventures. It's all about as Harry will overcome Lord Voldemort and save the magic word.It's set in Lodon, but no in the real Lodon. Harry Potter has amazing side of London consists of places like Hogwarts, Diagon- al, Hogsmeade and many other places.The main characters are the group of friends: Harry Potter, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger, they live many advetures. This film is not only a awesome film, all the films have been a success financially and critically, making the franchise one of the major Hollywood \"tent-poles\". The story has been with me since 2002, I really recommend, and you are love it.\n",

Harry is a scapegoat and later punished for this happening. The story tells readers how Harry's life is in a very hard time and suffering for ten years since he was very young.\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: You can't deny that the beginning of the Harry Potter series basically marked the beginning of your childhood and the inevitable roller- coaster of emotion we had all hopped aboard for. I remember when this first came out in 2001 and it was unlike any other movie I had ever seen, with monsters, adventures and magic it truly was something unthinkable for young me. If you have yet to see the first of this remarkable eight-part story (counting the deathly hollows as two) I highly recommend to put this on your watch-list and let Harry and his friends take you on one of the most unforgettable journeys of your life.\n",
            "Rating: 10, Review: Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's stone was released in 2001, and Daniel Radcliffe was starred in all the film in the Harry Potter series. Chris Columbus directed this fantasy movie based on the novel 'Harry Potter' by J. K. Rowling. Harry Potter shows the purity of children and gives us a chance to look back on our lives. We can see the kind of magic we could imagine when we were children such as making something floating in the sky, getting in a car which can fly in the sky, and magic that can make someone or something invisible.\n",

Harry Potter realizes that he is a wizard and meets new friends and some unfortunate events/people. Harry Potter realizes that magic can help you through tough times. If you decide that your kids should see this move, they may have a tough time realizing that magic is not real. This movie teaches kids that friends are there for you and can help you achieve greatness. Harry Potter realizes even with a bad family life (Parents who are not there for Harry and a mean uncle/aunt and cousin) he still manages to live a full and adventurous life. This movie is a AMAZING movie and I totally recommend seeing it.\n",

            "Rating: 10, Review: Harry Potter and the Philosophers stone, this was the movie that started the whole rage about harry potter. Now don;t get me wrong the books did all the work but the movie enhanced the series even more. In this first Harry Potter there was a lot more of on location sites shot than the rest of the Harry Potter films. As you can see whenever they are out on the courtyard, or when they are first learning how to fly. I think this adds a certain aspect to the movie where it still kinda humanizes it and since it is being shot on something that is real it makes us think that it is real. Versus it being shot in a studio with a lot of graphic events. The only reason I gave this movie a 10 out of 10 is probably because it is my favorite movie ever. The other Harry Potter movies are good but this one sets the tone for the rest of them all. Harry is such a universal character that the movie makes us feel apart of him. Not that we are all wizards or know what it is like to sleep under a staircase but it's his internal qualities that make people fall in love with him. Plus a whole lot of this movie is also a lot of exploration of the whole wizarding world that we get to see through Harry's eyes and experience it for the first time with him. So we can connect with him. This movie is a must see, no matter what.\n",

Or is it just so in India. I also asked a couple of other people that have seen the the movie and they had the same problem. Plus, I think the director has taken too many liberties in 'interpreting' the book. Why has he altered details from the book? I think it would have been best to have left things the way they were in the book. But then again, he's the director. On the whole, this is a movie that you should check out. Despite my panning of the director, I would like to congratulate him on the depiction of Lord Voldemort. A hint of 'Spawn' in the way he came to life, though, eh?\n",
